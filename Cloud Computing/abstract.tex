This report summarizes the work carried out within the framework of our ExpressIT System as part of our project during the summer internship of our curriculum within our engineering schools at \textbf{ODC} (ORANGE DIGITAL CENTER).\\\\
}
\Large {
The main objective of this work is to create a system that will be \textbf{"A bridge of communication between Deaf and/or Dumb people and the rest of society"}.\\\\
}
\Large {
This work consists of several phases of creating a Startup including the market analysis phase, the design phase and the development phase, while using different tools and discovering several concepts that helped us to develop this system. These tools include: MERN Stack, FIREBASE database management system, Google Coud Platform, RasberryPi Configuration, PYTHON, as the development language of a Machine Learning model for the AI behaviour of our project.\\\\
}
\Large {
The rest of this report is organized as follows: Chapter I is dedicated to the presentation and the Team Market part. Chapter II deals with problem analysis and design for Team Dev. Chapter III describes the use of Machine Learning on our project and lastly the Chapter IV presents the implementation of the solution.\\\\
