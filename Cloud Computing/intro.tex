\Large In the scope of our second-year studies at the National Institut of Posts and Telecommunications, we were brought to make this project entitled \textbf{"OpenStack Installation and Configuration"} an exam for the \textbf{CLOUD COMPUTING AND DISTRIBUTED ARCHITECTURES course}.
\\\\
The final goal of this project is to go through several steps in order to create a \textbf{Private Cloud infrastructure} using OpenStack.
\\\\
\textbf{OpenStack} is a cloud operating system capable of controlling a large number of server, network and storage resources distributed in the data center and managed through a web console that also allows cloud users to easily consume them. 
\\\\
So this project we will try to build our own Private Cloud using this open-source cloud platform in a virtual machine with a \textbf{CentOS8}. \\
