In conclusion, we tried in this humble project to make a basic version of an application using multiple technologies. The objective of this project is ultimately to create a Log Visualiser with Spark streaming, Elasticsearch, Kibana and Kafka.  \\
\par \Large To accomplish this we have carried out several steps including: 
\begin{flushleft} \large
{
\item \textbf{-Deciding the Project Architecture,} \\[0.7cm]
\item \textbf{-Making a version with a first method: data source reading from files,}\\[0.7cm]
\item \textbf{-Second method using Kafka for streaming,}\\[0.7cm]
\item \textbf{And finally, we finished with the Configuration and use cases of Kibana.}
\item
}
\end{flushleft}

A project which aims to inject the data from the logs with Spark Streaming and to restore the result in the form of a dashboard under Kibana, which makes it easier to view and analyze the contents of the log files, this information can give us information on the profile of the user through his preferences and the sites he frequents the most. We can through this information and with the help of deep-learning algorithms make targeted advertising (it is the idea of a new project which will complete this one and which will be more useful).
\\\\
It was a pleasant and enjoyable project in which we acquired a lot of knowledge and skills.
We thank our dear supervisor, Mr.ZIYATI Houssaine, for these efforts and for the next adventure.
