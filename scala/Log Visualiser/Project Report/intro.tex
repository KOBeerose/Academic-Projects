\Large In the scope of our second-year studies at the National Institut of Posts and Telecommunications, we were brought to make this project entitled \textbf{"Realizing a log visualiser with Spark streaming, Elasticsearch and Kibana."} for the \textbf{SCALA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE} Course.\\

\\\\

The main objective of this project is to inject the data coming from a log file with \textbf{Spark Streaming} and return the result in the form of a \textbf{Dashboard} under \textbf{Kibana}, But before tackling the development part of our application, we will first introduce the different technologies used in this project.
