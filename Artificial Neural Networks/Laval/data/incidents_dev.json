In  order to complete the work quickly Employee #1 and a coworker  under the  direction of a supervisor  began installing only whole pieces of plywood  measuring approximately 4 by 8 feet. Because the plywood did not fit the roof  area precisely  holes and gaps were left in various areas.

As Employee #1  and the coworker were beginning to install smaller pieces of plywood to fill  the gaps  Employee #1 stepped on the portion of the plywood with the two-inch  gap. The gap came loose from its securing nails  causing Employee #1 to fall  15 feet 9 inches to a cement slab below. Employee #1 was hospitalized and  treated for multiple fractures. Employee #1 had only been employed by the  employer for approximately one month.                                           ",

The San Francisco Fire Department reported this incident to Cal/OSHA   which began its investigation August 22  2013. The investigator determined  that Employee #1 had more than 27 years of carpentry experience and was  knowledgeable in the use and hazards of table saws. During the interview   Employee #1 asserted that he had not removed the blade guard (hood assembly).  He did acknowledge that he was not using a push stick  because he did not  think it was necessary. The investigation report stated that if the guard was  not removed  the primary cause of this accident was the failure to use a push  stick. Because the employee was working alone  and the employer was not  present  the employer's knowledge could not be established. Therefore  no  serious accident-related violation was issued. The employer was cited for  failure to timely report the serious injury to the District Office of  Cal-OSHA.                                                                       ",

The  bulldozer operator would normally make three runs (forward and backward)  spreading the pile of dirt by thirds about 30 to 50 feet from the pile. At the  time of the incident the bulldozer operator was filling in a slight hole about  2 inches deep caused by the blade of the dozer dipping on his last backward  run. The hole was only about 20 feet forward of where the operator directed  the dump truck operator to dump the dirt. This made the forward run a lot  shorter than normal. The bulldozer operator made his run forward  however   stopped shorter than normal due to the dirt filling in the hole. The bulldozer  operator would normally put the dozer in reverse on the fly which means as he  is moving forward he would raise the blade  slow down  put it in reverse   start moving backwards  lower the blade  and then look behind him. Since it  was a shot run (only 10 - 15 feet to fill in the hole)  as he started to move  backwards it was about 2-3 seconds before he looked behind him  and when he  did noticed either the hard hat or survey rod fly in the air and he knew he  had struck the employee.

The shore was  made of aluminum. It had dimensions of 22 inches (0.56 meters) by 36 inches  (0.91 meters).

The building was undergoing extensive exterior  restoration due to water damage  including removing the masonry facade and  cleaning the rusted steel beam using pneumatic hammers and needle guns. Two  gasoline powered air compressors (Rolair Systems with Honda engines  Model  #8422HK30) had been placed on the third floor roof of the building. Each  compressor had a 1.5-gallon gas tank and a 9-gallon air tank. In addition   each compressor had a 7.5-gallon auxiliary air tank. The compressors were  usually refueled twice a day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon.  Gasoline was kept in a 5-gallon type-I flammable liquid can equipped with a  plastic funnel. The employer had recently purchased a different brand of  flammable liquid can (Justrite) whose attached funnel was designed so that it  could be bent and take less space during storage/transportation. That feature  made the funnel susceptible to leakage when pouring the liquid. Employee #1  was refueling one of the compressors. The employer's procedure for refueling  the air compressors  as well as other gas powered equipment  was to ensure the  engine was off. According to the employer's subsequent statement  as Employee  #1 refueled the compressor  the gasoline leaked from the two sides of the  attached funnel onto the hot muffler of the compressor and ignited. Coworkers  #1 and #2  who were on the swing stage  suddenly lost air pressure on their  needle guns and saw that the compressors were on fire. They grabbed their fire  extinguisher and assisted Employee #1 to extinguish the fire. The fire was  extinguished by the time the Fire Department arrived. Employee #1 was  transported to a hospital  where he was treated for a first degree burn on his  right forearm  burns to the face  and smoke inhalation. He was then released.  The cause of the accident was spilling of gasoline onto the hot muffler.  Cal/OSHA regulation T8 CCR 5451(e) requires employers to take precautions  against liquid spillage and sources of ignition when transferring flammable  and combustible liquid from one container into another.

Employee # 2 loaded  the truck with approximately 5.09 tons of number seven rocks  and Employee #1  proceeded to drive to Baron Ballpark  which was approximately 0.9 to 1.2 miles  away. Employee # 1 backed the dump truck into the desired dump area. Employee  # 1 parked the truck  and from inside the cab  shifted the \"HOIST\" lever into  the \"RAISE\" position in order to raise the dump bed. He then shifted the \"PTO\"  lever into the \"IN\" position in order to put the hydraulic fluid pump in gear.  Employee # 1 exited the cab of the truck and notice that she had not opened  the tailgate prior to raising the dump bed. Employee # 1 then got back into  the cab of the truck and shifted the \"HOIST\" lever to the \"LOWER\" position in  order to try to lower the dump bed so she could remove the chain from the  tailgate release lever and engage the lever. However  the dump bed would not  lower because the load of rocks had all shifted upon raising the dump bed  and  were resting against the tail gate  creating a counter- weight to the  hydraulic system; the imbalance of weight prevented the dump bed from being  able to be lowered. Employee # 1 proceeded to climb up into the dump bed with  a shovel and began shoveling rock out in order to reduce the amount of  counter-weight so the dump bed could be lowered and the tailgate release  engaged; the attempt was unsuccessful. She climbed out of the dump bed and up  onto a set of the rear tires and proceeded to utilize the shovel to try to  reach high enough to undo the tailgate lever chain and engage the tailgate  lever; the attempts were unsuccessful. Finally  Employee # 1 climbed up onto  the portion of the truck frame directly behind the rear of the cab. She was  standing underneath the raised dump bed  facing the rear window of the cab.

The machine  under consideration is a 300-ton capacity press with 12 to 16 strokes per  minute  manufactured by Shimomura Press Manufacturing Company of Japan   machine model number DCLP-300-22E. The punch press is a part revolution  machine with emergency stop pushbuttons installed at five locations including  at both hand pushbutton panels. Pressing one of these buttons causes the slide  to stop immediately. In order to ensure the safety of the operator during the  downward movement of the slide  the machine is designed to require the use of  both hands to press the pushbuttons continuously until the slide reaches the  lower dead point. The machine works two shifts every working day and it makes  about 12 different Toyota truck body parts. At the time of the accident   Employee #1 was working by himself. The employee had been working in this  machine for four years. While changing die for stamping fuel tank upper part  number 7711102100  Employee #1 pressed the two (hand) pushbuttons and the  slide went down. As he released his hands  the slide/die eventually went up.  Employee #1 leaned forward (across) to reach the air ejector valve for making  some adjustments.

His employer was the general  contractor for the project. However  there was no foreman at the site  and all  workers other than Employee #1 were employed by subcontractors. Employee #1  was patching drywall near and on the 14-foot ceiling while standing on a  Werner 10-foot fiberglass step ladder. This extra heavy duty ladder had a  rated working load of 300 pounds. Employee #1 was 5 feet 4 inches tall and  weighed 163 pounds. Employee #1 was holding the patching compound and spatula  while standing on the second step below the topcap of the step ladder. The  ladder tipped to one side  and Employee #1 fell to the ground  a fall height  of 10 feet. Nearby subcontractor workers heard the fall and saw Employee #1  lying on the ground in pain. They phoned a foreman who was at another  location. The foreman came to the restaurant and called for emergency  services. An ambulance arrived  and Employee #1 was transported to San  Francisco General Hospital. He was admitted and treated for compressed neck  vertebrae  a large hematoma on the right upper side of his head  nerve damage   and spinal pain. He remained hospitalized for four days. This event was  reported to Cal/OSHA on either December 21 or December 23  2013  by a relative  of Employee #1. During the subsequent investigation  begun at the job site on  January 10  2014  interviews were conducted with the employer  Employee #1   and Employee #1's relative. It was established that Employee #1 was standing  on the second step below the ladder's topcap  and this step was 7 feet 8  inches above the ground. He was leaning past the ladder side rails while  patching the drywall. His work position contributed to his fall. The  investigation revealed conflicting versions of what happened next and how soon  the ambulance arrived. Initially  the size and height of the step ladder also  were in dispute. According to Employee #1  after he fell he had to wait  approximately 45 minutes for a foreman to arrive from another jobsite. When  the foreman arrived  he removed the fallen ladder and wanted to move Employee  #1 to his (Employee #1's) house before contacting an ambulance. Employee #1   who was still on the ground  was screaming in pain and said not to move or  touch him and to call the ambulance. The foreman finally made the call for  emergency services. In contrast  according to the employer  a foreman employed  by another company  who was doing the employer a favor by opening up the  jobsite while the employer was away in Canada  called him and reported the  fall event to him. The employer then instructed the foreman to go to the  jobsite. According to the employer  who stated he was on the phone with the  foreman the entire time  it took the foreman approximately 10 minutes to  arrive at the job site. When the foreman arrived  the employer told him to  call emergency services. Based on the Cal/OSHA investigation  the employer was  cited a general accident-related violation: T8 CCR '3276(e)(15)(A) requires  employees to work near the middle of the step and not to overreach. Other  standards relating to ladders were violated  and the employer was cited  accordingly. However  the investigation was not able to establish employer  knowledge.

The available area was  approximately nine ft four ins. by 10 ft six ins.  with two exposed sides  guarded by a perimeter cable system. Eight sheets of drywall (either four ft  by eight ft or four ft by nine ft) had been stacked on their edges  and these  stacks leaned against the perimeter cable. This left less than one ft on each  side for Employee #1 and the coworker to get to the perimeter cable to see the  nails sticking out of the deck edge of that floor and that of the floor above.  It appeared that as they let go of the cable  the stack of sheetrock tipped  over and fell on Employee #1's right lower leg  fracturing his tibia and  fibula bones. Employee #1 was hospitalized. The cause of the accident was  improper stacking and placing of sheetrock. T8 CCR 1549 (d) prohibited  stacking sheetrock on its edge unless positively secured against tipping or  falling. Moreover  T8 CCR 1549 (e) prohibited placing material inside  buildings under construction within 10 ft of an exterior wall  which does not  extend above the top of the material unless the material is positively secured  to prevent it from falling. No serious accident-related citation was issued  because none of the contractors admitted that they had placed the sheetrock in  that position. However  the Employer  as well as the Sheetrock subcontractor  and the General Contractor  were cited with General Citations under the  Multi-Employer worksite Standard (T8 CCR 336.10) as the Exposing   Creating/Correcting  and Controlling Employers  respectively.

A two-tier  wale system had been installed inside the perimeter of the shoring walls with  the lower tier being W27x102 I-beams  while the upper tier consisted of W21x55  I-beams. Numerous approximately 6 ft long steel vertical members had been  bolted up between the two wale levels. The wale system was suspended in place  in the four corners via wire rope fed through holes in the sheet piles  looped  under the top wale and tied back to itself. The wire rope loops were  constructed with .815 in. 6x25 EIP IW RREG wire rope utilizing a parallel lap  splice. Only two wire rope clips were in place at each splice  one for each  dead end. As part of the backfilling/shoring removal operations  the lower  section of wales and vertical members had been dismantled with the vertical  members and three of the four lower wales having been removed from the area.  The lower east wale was unable to be removed from the shored area due to space  constraints and had been chained up to the upper wale.

These boards were  within 9 in. of the exposed live current parts. The generator was set up in  Phase 3  power factor 0.8  kilowatts 33  kilovolt-ampere 41  amperes 50 and  factory test and reconnect F. Its model number was 33RZ272 and serial number  was 245558 and was setup in voltage of 277/480. The generator was operating in  normal operating limits with no problems. Employee #1 removed the positive  battery cable on the generator and turned the generator in the off position.  He then removed the front housing on the generator to access the area for  replacing the SCR board and the photo board. Employee #1 used a socket wrench  that was 7.5 in. long with a 2.375 in. deep well six-point socket to remove a  2.125 in. course thread bolt in the generator. As he removed the bolt  the  wrench contacted a live terminal from the rear switch on the generator  which  electrocuted him with approximately 277 volts. The incident occurred between  1:30 p.m.  the time he arrived onsite and 9:00 a.m. on the next day. The  assistant principal was on the kitchen dock  located behind the school  around  5:00 p.m. when he noticed Employee 1's company van still outside the  electrical room  but did not check on him at that time. The next morning  a  coworker called the school and spoke with the assistant principal  telling him  that he had not heard from Employee #1 since early the day before. The  assistant principal told the coworker to hold on while he went to the area  where Employee 1 was working. When he arrived on scene  he noticed Employee #1  slumped over on his knees with a reach still into the generator. At the point   the assistant principal called the school resource officer and school nurse to  the area. The resource officer instructed the assistant principal to have  power to the entire school shut down before removing Employee #1 due to the  concern that he was still energized. Power was shut down and he was removed  and power was restored to the school. From the investigation  blue wires were  found inside a closed electric box located 18 inches away. The blue wires went  outside and then underground to another building to power lights. These blue  wires on the hot side of the emergency lights breaker box created a back feed  to the generator  which would have caused the generator to be hot even if the  switches were in the off position on the generator. Black and white tape was  placed to insure no exposed wires were visible even in the off position.        ",

Interviews were conducted with Employee #1   Employee #1's supervisor (partial interview)  and injured coworkers. The  investigation concluded that Employee #1 had not been using or required to use  approved fall protection  and the Primary Employer  Barrett Business Services  Inc.  did not ensure or verify that at the time of Employee #1's fall he was  using or required to use approved fall protection. This violation of CCR Title  8 Section 1670(a) was determined to be the cause of the fall. Cal/OSHA issued  a Serious Accident Related citation to the Secondary Employer  T & T  Improvements  and a General citation to the Primary Employer  Barrett Business  Services (the latter citation due to lack of evidence of employer knowledge)  according to CCR Title 8 Section 1670(a).

He was then sent  to the Bakersfield  CA  area to gain climbing experience for a towerman  rating. The majority of his work was conducted in the southern San Joaquin  Valley. It involved a crew of two climbers and a groundsman who inspected  towers for housekeeping  footing defects  bent or rusted components  loose  bolts  and guy tensions. The crews used all-terrain vehicles to access remote  towers  which exposed them to a significant amount of dust. In June  2006   after five weeks in this position   Employee #1 developed a cough; in the  sixth week  his supervisor restricted him to groundsman duties. The next  weekend  he was seen by a physician  who diagnosed walking pneumonia and  prescribed medication. Employee #1's condition deteriorated and his cough  progressed enough that his supervisor and coworkers became concerned. On  returning home  Employee #1 went to the hospital  where he was admitted for  pneumonia. He called his lead supervisor on June 23  2006  and left a message  reporting that he was in the hospital. The morning of June 24  the lead  supervisor contacted him to confirm hospitalization and was told that Employee  #1 had been diagnosed with pneumonia. The lead supervisor visited Employee #1  in the hospital on June 26  and subsequently was informed that Employee #1 had  contracted a fungal infection called Valley fever (Coccidioides immitis) while  working in the Bakersfield area. Valley fever is a well-known endemic  environmental health hazard in Kern County with increasing prevalence. The  employer had an effective safety and health program  including hazard  awareness training for Valley fever. In addition  employees received in-depth  annual safety/health training for hazards to which they might be exposed.  Employee #1 had not received this training  although adequate awareness  training was documented in a tailboard meeting. The root cause of Employee  #1's condition was determined to be misdiagnosis by the medical provider and  failure to mitigate the progression of illness. A contributing factor was the  fact that Employee #1 was a new employee without accumulated sick leave or the  capacity to suffer financial hardship.                                          ",

The window was kept closed  and no additional ventilation  was provided. The refinishing process typically took two to three hours to  complete. The first step in the process was to strip the old polyurethane  finish from the tub  which took approximately 20 to 30 minutes. A stripping  agent called KLEAN STRIP that contained 80 - 85 percent methylene chloride was  used. A pint of KLEAN STRIP was poured into the tub and spread around the tub  with a brush. It was allowed to react with the old finish  and the loosened  finish was removed from the tub with a scraper. The loosened finish was then  brushed into a dustpan and dumped into a plastic bag. The tub was washed down  with water and a cleanser  dried with paper towels and compressed air  and  sanded to remove burrs. The tub was ready to be masked and sprayed with a new  polyurethane finish. The employee was not wearing respiratory protection. When  the homeowners noticed that there was no noise coming from the bathroom  they  went to the room to discover the employee slumped over the tub. They tried to  administer medical aid and called for emergency services  but the employee was  dead. The cause of death was due to methylene chloride intoxication.            ",

The Program requirement  includes a requirement for the employer to provide and document training for  employees. The employer had no documentation of Employee #1's training. In  addition  the use of the powered circular saw was not appropriate for reducing  the thickness of the wood board.
