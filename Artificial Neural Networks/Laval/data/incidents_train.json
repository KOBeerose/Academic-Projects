He was operating a scissor lift  a Skyjack SJ111-3219  Equipment No.  103319. He moved the lift to the area where he intended to run electrical  wires. After positioning the lift  he raised the lift's platform to reach the  conduit on the ceiling. Employee #1 pushed the electrical wires from the left  conduit to the right. After pushing the wires into the conduit  he needed to  move the lift forward and to his right to pull the electrical wires from the  other conduit. He was looking down from the top guardrail of the lift as he  reached for the lift's controller behind him with his right hand  to move the  lift forward. Employee #1 pushed the controller forward to drive the lift to  the right. However  the lift's platform rose up. Employee #1 realized the  toggle switch was on \"lift\" mode instead of a \"drive\" mode. He immediately  released the controller and tried to move the platform down  but it continued  to move up. Employee #1's face was caught between the lift's top guardrail and  an overhead pipe. Eventually  Employee #1 was able to bring the platform down.  Emergency services were called  and the San Mateo Fire Department responded.  Employee #1 was transported to the hospital  where he was admitted and treated  for multiple facial fractures. He was hospitalized for approximately three  days. This event was reported to Cal/OSHA by the San Mateo Fire Department and  the Employer at approximately 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.  respectively  on July  18  2013. Cal/OSHA initiated its investigation at the work site at  approximately 10:15 a.m. on July 30  2013. Participating in the inspection  were Employee #1's foreman/supervisor  the project superintendent of the  general contractor  and the field operations manager of the general  contractor. The investigation revealed that Employee #1's employer had leased  the scissor lift from Sunstate Equipment since October 16  2012. The employer  returned the scissor lift to Sunstate Equipment on July 19  2013  the day  after Employee #1 was injured. While the equipment was in the employer's  possession  the lift's relay switch was replaced to correct a steering  problem  and the platform control box was replaced due to the lift's inability  to go up. Cal/OSHA did not issue an Accident-Related citation  because the  investigation determined that the cause was not a violation of Title 8   California Code of Regulations (T8 CCR). However  Cal/OSHA issued one General  Citation for the employer's failure to train and instruct its employee in the  proper use of Skyjack III 3219 Scissor Lift  in accordance with the  manufacturer's operating instructions  and Section 3203  Injury and Illness  Prevention Program  a violation of T8 CCR  Section 3638(d).

Employee #1  who was the only employee in the company  outside of Employer #1  was on site welding on a sifter screen near the gravel  crusher. Employer #1 and Employee #1 discussed the day's tasks to be  completed  and Employer #1 then began operating a backhoe on the far side of  the site. At approximately 10:30 a.m.  Employer #1 observed Employee #1 pull a  Cat 966 front end loader into position  approximately 50 yards from Employer  #1's work position. Employee #1's final work position was located outside of  Employer #1's sight line  behind a 25-foot gravel pile. A few minutes after  Employee #1 pulled the front end loader into position  the employer observed  Employee #1 carrying a sledgehammer. Approximately 5 minutes later  Employer  #1 was interrupted by some employees of the land owner calling for him to stop  work. He immediately shut the backhoe down and walked over to the area near  the front end loader where he found Employee #1 lying face down  with his arms  by his side. Employee #1 was also experiencing labored breathing. Employer #1  called emergency services and informed them of the emergency. Employer #1 then  rolled Employee #1 over to ascertain his condition. Employee #1 was laboring  to breathe and could not talk. When he was asked where he was hurting   Employee #1 pointed to his lower left side. Approximately 10 minutes after the  call to emergency services was placed  paramedics and other emergency  personnel arrived. Employee #1 was treated and within a few minutes the  paramedics braced Employee #1's neck and back and placed him on a gurney and  loaded him up for transport to the hospital. Employee #1 was taken to Lincoln  General West hospital  where he underwent treatment. The full extent of  Employee #1's injuries were not known  but it is possible that Employee #1 may  have suffered some internal injuries  and definitely had scrapes to his chest.  Interviews with Employer #1 and observation of the site indicated that most  likely Employee #1 was using a sledgehammer to pound on a retaining pin from  the dog bone on the bucket to the actuating arm of the front end loader. Due  to the fact that Employee #1 was working alone at the time of the accident   the exact nature of the accident is unknown.                                    ",

Employee #1 was working  from an aluminum extension ladder at the south end of the west wall and  scraping paint from the wall while Coworker #1 held the ladder steady.  Employee #1 climbed to the seventh step of the ladder  approximately 80 inches  from the floor. Coworker #1 received a telephone call from Coworker #2  requesting that he open the alley vehicle door. Coworker #1 asked Employee #1  if he needed to come down from the ladder while Coworker #1 moved away to open  the door. Employee #1 said the ladder was steady and he would continue  working. Coworker #1 moved away from his position holding the ladder steady  and opened the alley door to allow Coworker #2 to drive into the building.  Coworker #1 then closed the door and began to walk back to Employee #1's  location. Before Coworker #1 reached the ladder  the ladder slipped  and  Employee #1 fell to the floor. Emergency personnel were called  and the Santa  Monica Fire Department responded and transported Employee #1 to UCLA Westwood  Medical Center. Employee #1 was treated in the emergency room for a laceration  to his forehead and a dislocated shoulder. He was released from the emergency  room at 7:00 p.m. on March 8  2013. Because Employee #1 did not sustain a  serious injury  his employer did not have an obligation to notify Cal/OSHA.

At 10:10 a.m. on March 13  2013  Cal/OSHA's Los  Angeles Division began an investigation at the site. Its investigation  determined that the area where the ladder legs were placed and where the fall  occurred was an automotive dealership vehicle service area that had a build-up  of oil and dirt on the floor. The ladder base safety feet were in serviceable  condition  but the slippery floor surface would require that other means be  employed to ensure ladder stability. While the ladder was being held by  Coworker #1  the ladder was secure. When Coworker #1 stopped holding the  ladder  it became unstable and ultimately slipped out from under Employee #1.  The Division planned to issue an accident related serious citation  a general  violation for T8 CCR 3276(e)(7) with lack of employer knowledge and a  non-serious injury.

They were assigned to repair a broken heater in the store's  rear storage room. Employee #1 had been on site the previous day  December 10   2013  to review the scope of the assignment and the material involved.  Employee #1 and Coworker #1 replaced the electric contact on the heater.  Employee #1 then went to check the 480 Volt Westinghouse Fusible Distribution  Panelboard (FDP)  Category FDPT3833 #3 panelboard unit in the store's  electrical cage  located in a separate room adjacent to the storage room  to  make sure that the heater could be energized. The panelboard unit  measuring  approximately 8 inches tall by 14 inches long  was installed along with other  panelboard units  approximately 3 feet from concrete on grade. The panelboard  unit contained a shutoff switch on the front side of the dead front panel to  disconnect the interior front fuse panel from the live busbar that energized  the panel from the interior rear of the panel unit. Employee #1 turned the 480  Volt  60 Amp T3833 FDP #3 switch to the off position and opened the dead front  to expose the TRS90R 90 Amp fuses in the panel. After a visual inspection of  the interior of the panelboard unit  Employee #1 metered the fuses in the  panel to ensure that the fuse panel was not energized. He determined that two  of the three fuses were inoperable and needed replacement. Employee #1 removed  the fuses with an insulated fuse puller. He then wound up the electrical meter  and took off his gloves. The door to the panelboard had swung into an almost  closed position and sat slightly ajar  approximately 3 inches. Before starting  toward his vehicle to retrieve two new fuses  Employee #1 reached to shut the  electrical panel door  so that store employees would not be exposed to an  electrical hazard while he was gone. As Employee #1 shut the panel door  a  live T3833 FDP #1 panelboard unit  approximately 8 inches above the FDP #3  that Employee #1 had been working in  and that had not been previously opened  and was dead front  had one or more arc flashes. The flashes blew out the top  of the dead fronted T3833 FDP #1  causing irreparable blast and burn damage.  The interior of the T3833 FDP #3 had burn marks on a small section of the  panel door. Employee #1 was seriously burned. He also experienced brief  blindness due to the flash. Coworker #1  who had been standing to the side   approximately 3 feet from the panel unit  also experienced brief blindness   but was otherwise uninjured. Emergency services were called  and Employee #1  was transported and admitted to Tuomey Hospital  and subsequently transferred  by emergency transport to the Augusta Burn Center. He was treated for second  and third degree burns to his hand and forearm. South Carolina OSHA's  subsequent investigation determined that Employee #1 had been wearing ANSI  Class 2 - 17 000 Volt electrical gloves  a fire resistant shirt  and safety  glasses while working  although  as noted above  he had removed his gloves  shortly before the arc flash event.

The  elevator fell approximately 18 feet. Emergency services were called. Employee  #1 was transported to the hospital and treated for a compressed T12 vertebra  and a chin laceration. He was not hospitalized. This event was reported to  Cal/OSHA on June 20  2013. The subsequent investigation revealed that the  elevator's malfunctioning was caused by a manufacturer's defect in the  threading of the hydraulic jack assembly.

        "text": " At approximately 10:00 a.m. on December 11  2013  Employee #1  a carpenter  foreman employed by Pacific Peninsula Group  was performing interior carpentry  at a residential construction site. He was using a Bosch 4000 stand-mounted  benchtop table saw with a 10-inch blade to cut wood pieces for framing  modifications. As he was making the first rip cut to a section of laminated  wood product measuring approximately 16 inches long by 1.75 inches wide by 4  inches high  his left hand contacted the blade. His left hand and fingers were  severely cut. Emergency services were called  and the Mountain View Fire  Department responded. Employee #1 was transported to Stanford Hospital  where  he was admitted and treated. His left middle finger  which had been completely  severed past the first knuckle near the palm  was surgically reattached. The  left ring finger  which was severed through the bone past the first knuckle   also was reattached  but during a return hospital visit this finger required  surgical amputation. This event was timely reported to Cal/OSHA by the  employer  and also reported by the Mountain View Fire Department. In its  subsequent investigation  Cal/OSHA identified the employer as a construction  management company performing as a general contractor for this residential  apartment building project  with tasks being performed by its own employees as  well as subcontractors. The task Employee #1 was performing required two rip  cuts to the section of laminated wood product to achieve the desired finished  piece  because the blade was capable of rising only to approximately 3 inches  high. Employee #1 was working alone  and no witness to the event was  identified. The guard for the Bosch 4000 included a hood  a splitter  and an  anti-kickback device combined as a single unit. This guard/hood was at the  site  but Employee #1 stated the guard was not installed on the saw at the  time he began to plan and perform his cuts. Employee #1 stated he set the rip  fence to the right of the blade at approximately 1.25 inches and had no other  anti-kickback attachments  separate from the guard/hood  available to install.  He also stated he did not install any featherboards or jigs to use as he made  cuts without the use of the guard/hood. Employee #1 stated he was pushing and  guiding the wood through the blade  with his right hand positioned at the end  of the wood length nearest to him  and his left hand positioned on the top and  at the end of the wood farther away from him. He stated there was no push  block or push stick at the saw  and he did not make one to use. He stated that  the first cut was almost complete  and the blade was about to come out at the  back side of the wood piece  when the wood kicked back and shot past his right  side. He stated his left hand was extended behind and over the saw blade  before the cut  but was pulled back partially by the kick-back  or his hand  movement may have been reflexive. The result was that his left hand contacted  the blade. The investigation report included a comment that the guard   anti-kickback  and spreader features of the Bosch 4000 were not separable.  They were designed to extend above and past the blade of the saw and would not  have allowed the uncut portion of the wood piece to have passed. The first cut  of the employee's two-step cutting plan was similar to a dado or cut where the  blade does not extend through the top of the wood. The report concluded that  the type of rip cut Employee #1 was making was allowable without use of the  blade's guard/hood only when additional protective devices  such as  featherboards  were being used and separate anti-kickback devices had been  installed. No protective devices  such as featherboards or anti-kickback  attachments  were available or installed on the table saw during the time when  the saw's guard/hood was not in place. No push sticks or push blocks were  available during the time when the table saw was being used.  ",

He was part of  a small crew assigned to paint a commercial space in the basement of a  shopping mall. Employee #1 was alone on the scaffold and using a spray gun to  paint the ceiling and upper areas of the room. Employee #1 fell from the  scaffold platform to the floor  a distance of approximately 7 feet. The San  Mateo Fire Department responded to a call for assistance. Employee #1 was  transported to Stanford Hospital  where he was admitted and treated for a  fractured skull and fractured left wrist. This event was timely reported to  Cal/OSHA by the employer and the San Mateo Fire Department. The subsequent  investigation determined that Employee #1 was working with Coworker #1 to  paint the area. Coworker #2  the crew foreman  was supervising Employee #1 and  Coworker #1. Another worker  Coworker #3  only had assisted with the scaffold  set-up at the start of the shift. Employee #1 and Coworker #2 stated the  scaffold platform was set at 7 feet  and they did not have enough room to  install both 4-foot guardrail end-sections and X-bracing for rails because the  fluorescent light fixtures were 11 feet above the floor. Both said that all  four wheel brakes were applied at the time of the fall. Coworkers #1 and #2  said they did not see Employee #1 actually fall off the scaffold and that  Employee #1 was the only worker on the scaffold. Employee #1 said he cannot  recall the actual fall but thinks he may have lost his balance. Coworkers #1  and #2 said that no ladders  buckets  or other objects were being used to gain  greater working height at the time of the fall. All four employees who had  involvement at the site stated that there were no defects or problems with the  scaffold. The scaffold was set up and measured during Cal/OSHA's inspection of  the site  and the platform was less than 7 feet 6 inches above surface  so  guardrails were not required in this configuration  per Section 1646. No  precipitating action for the fall was definitively established. Employee #1  may have fallen as he was coming down off the scaffold  or as he lost balance  on the platform  or by accidentally stepping past the platform edge.

Employee # 1 was standing on the  ground  checking the depth of the cut into the asphalt  using a handheld  pendant attached to the machine. The pedant could stretch out from ten to 15  ft.

A different company  Protective Services Inc.

Employee #1 was positioned between the milling machine and the  concrete median dividers  inside the coned off work zone.

Employee #1 was standing approximately three ft in the far inside lane on the  ground between milling machine and interior median wall inside of the approved  traffic control set up  and approximately midway up the machine and 17 ft from  the traffic control devices and flow of traffic.

Employee #2 was working as the driver of a CAT AP-1055D Track  Asphalt Paver  and was working in the vicinity of a dump truck that was  loading asphalt into the paver. There had been over 40 similar loads made that  day  all with the hitch arm assembly of the paver fully extended outward to  allow the truck bed to get in a clear position for the dump. A spotter had  also been present for all of these earlier loads  and the job of this spotter  was to assist the alignment of the paver and truck. On this particular dump   the paver's operator was not aware that he had laterally retracted the left  and right hitch arms at the front of the paver  moving the arms inward  while  the dump truck carrying asphalt was backing up to offload asphalt into the  paver's hopper.

The TBM had been excavating in closed mode for  approximately 17 days. Closed mode is a term used to describe one of two modes  of operation this TBM was capable of performing  the other being open mode.  Closed mode excavation involves the pressurization of the cutterhead and face  of the TBM to support the ground and/or control excessive groundwater inflows.  The position of the TBM found it excavating through a large vertical fault  zone that later became the Detachment Fault. The ground conditions required  the TBM face to be pressurized to approximately 13 bars of pressure. The grout  being injected in the annular space was being pumped in at approximately 14  bars. The swing shift had begun work and was preparing to erect a ring segment  set; Ring #135. The swing shift began to build Ring #135 at about 4:00 p.m.  The first segment was successfully installed in the tunnel crown (top of the  tunnel). The crew then began to install the second segment  which was to be  placed in front of the keystone of Ring #134. Three hydraulic rams  including  one abutting the keystone of Ring #134  were slowly retracted. Almost as soon  as the retraction began  a loud pop was heard. Some members of the crew  reported hearing a second pop. The keystone for Ring #134 had shifted forward  approximately 4 inches. The come-a-long did not hold the forces exerted  and  the gears were stripped out. This shift permitted grout and other materials  such as rocks to escape the annulus at a pressure of approximately 14 bars  (200 psi). Employee #1 was standing in front of the area where the gap  developed. He was struck and killed by the moving grout and rocks. Coworkers  found Employee #1 and removed him from the tunnel.                              ",

He was hospitalized and treated for head trauma  lacerations to the  scalp that required five stitches  and a torn tendon in his left knee that  required surgery. Investigation determined that the power buggy was operated  on a 6-degree slope on a public county road  whereas the operator's manual did  not permit the buggy to be driven on public roadways. The manual specified a  maximum buggy speed of 7 mph  and the operator was traveling at approximately  5 mph. The operator was hauling large rocks  an activity not permitted by the  buggy manufacturer. The operator's manual states that the buggy is intended to  haul only free-flowing material. The employee was not trained in the safe  operation of the power buggy.                                                   ",

A rubber tired  Grove RT 745 Crane was being used to  assist in the rigging process. A lifting mechanism that consisted of a choker   shackle  ropes and a cotter pin was being used. Based on the task at hand  the  ground man would have attached the hinge pin through the shackle and then  through the column splice lug hole and back through the other side of the  shackle hole. A cotter pin would then be placed through the end tip of the  hinge pin. A nylon rope would also be attached to the handle side of the hinge  pin. Another nylon rope would be connected to the cotter pin so that when the  steel column was erected  the rope would be pulled  the cotter pin would fall  out and then the rope connected to the hinge pin would be pulled and that  portion of the rigging apparatus would fall to the ground. The investigation  revealed that during the initial set up  the cotter pin was placed down side  up; so if the rope is pulled  the pin would not pop out. The coworker signaled  the crane operator to begin the lift. As the column was being raised  the  ground man noticed the inverted cotter pin and motioned the crane operator to  stop. At that time  the ground man adjusted the cotter pin and motioned the  crane operator to continue the lift.

Employee #1  was standing on a ledge to the right side of the boom  approximately 8 feet 4  inches above the ground. Employee #1 and Coworker #1 both were working at the  boom level without fall protection. Coworker #1 said he safely held onto a  fixed part of the crane to prevent himself from falling. Employee #1 said  there was no handhold where he was standing  so he securely grasped the top of  the boom cover  a fixed structure  by placing the fingers of his left hand  inside the holes as he guided the steel cable with his right hand  on which he  wore a wire glove. According to the employer's Safety Director  Employee #1   while spooling the first layer  needed to hold the cable and tap it with a  hammer to ensure the cable was wrapped tight and close together.

Employee #1 was transported to the hospital  where  he was admitted and treated for amputation of the left hand index finger.

As he started making the  cut he inadvertently placed weight on the cut portion of the metal roofing  causing it to give way. He fell through the opening head first. Employee #1  landed on a conveyor approximately 15 feet below the opening. Employee #1  sustained fractures to three thoracic vertebrae with fractures to the adjacent  ribs and a laceration to the scalp. Employee #1 was transported by ambulance  to the Emanuel Medical Center in Turlock; he was hospitalized for three days.  The accident was caused by the employee inadvertently placing weight onto the  already partially cut portion of the roof metal which subsequently gave way.  Employee #3  the Office Manager for Ram Mechanical Inc. reported the injury to  the Modesto District Office on June 2  2011 at 1:30 p.m. A second notification  was received by the Modesto District Office from the Turlock Police/Fire  Dispatch on June 2  2011 at 1:50 p.m. The reporting requirements were met.

The roof had a  slightly sloped and uneven surface  as it was covered with curved ceramic  tiles. Employee #1 stated that he was using this stepladder as a single  ladder. That is  he was using it without opening it. Rather than have all four  of the ladder's feet on the surface of the roof  he had only two of the  ladder's feet on the roof. The top of the ladder was leaning against a wall.  Employee #1 stated that the ladder was accordingly not secure. While Employee  #1 was on the ladder  it started slipping off the roof.

He then bounced to the stairways below the stucco column  where he hit  his head on the metal railing of stairways. He landed on the sidewalk and  finally stopped falling.

A large  flatbed truck had arrived at the site with crates carrying 14 sheets of  heavy-duty reinforced glass. Each sheet measured 4 ft by 8 ft  was  0.5625-in.-thick  and weighed about 350 lbs. Normally  the sheets in their  crates would be unloaded with a forklift. However  the owner of the company  had not been able to rent a forklift  and the delivery driver indicated to the  employer that he needed to leave to continue work. According to the police  report  the co-owner of the company admitted that he and the owner had agreed  to \"loose lite\" the load  that is  unload each sheet individually by hand   using suction discs. This procedure was normally used for smaller sheets that  arrived on inclined racks on a smaller truck. The co-owner (the site  supervisor) admitted to having concerns when he observed the way the load had  been shipped  and admitted that the company had never unloaded glass of that  size by hand from a flatbed. At the time of the inspection  it was observed  that the main shipping crate was posted with a large sign stating \"Do not open  any case and attempt lite by lite unloading.\" The company owner stated in an  interview that he was aware that there is a safety regulation stating that  materials being unloaded must be secured against dangerous displacement. At  the time of the accident  there were two employees up on the flatbed and a  foreman and the supervisor/co-owner standing in the street. Employee #1 cut  the bands holding the front covers of the crates and opened the first crate on  the driver's side of the flatbed to begin to separate the sheets. A safety  line consisting of a single nylon rope had been tied mid-way down one of the  vertical supports of the crate holder. Before this rope was anchored  the  upright sheets began to tip over. According to witness statements  Employee #1  attempted to jump in front of the sheets to keep them from falling. He was  knocked off the flatbed by the weight of the falling sheets and at least five  sheets fell and crushed him on the street  a distance of 4.6 ft. below the  flatbed.

He  had been mining and mucking for about an hour when he noticed a slow drip  coming from the right front port plug. Employee #1 pulled back and raised the  boom slightly to investigate it. At this time  Employee #1 did not notice any  significant damage to the plug  and the drip stopped when pressure was applied  to the cylinder. He called on the mine phone and spoke to his coworker  a  contractor at the site  who was at the bottom of an exit shaft  about 2 400 ft  back. He told Employee #1 that he would get a new plug. Employee #1 resumed  his work  moved the boom forward  and then was moving the boom either up or  down when the plug blew out. It struck Employee #1's left hand with sufficient  force to break off the left joystick and cause significant trauma. He was  evacuated from the tunnel and taken to the hospital  where he underwent the  surgical amputation of his left middle finger back to the wrist and the  relocation of his index finger to the middle position. After the accident the  plug was found to have been damaged  probably by rocks and boulders while  mining or mucking. The damage to the head caused the threaded portion to take  on an oval shape that was approximately 1/8 in. out of round. The full depth  of the threads on the ends of the oval were damaged consistent with the plug  being ejected. The threads on the sides of the oval were undamaged  indicating  that these were not engaged due to the shape of the plug after it was damaged.  While mining prior to the accident  the pressure in the hydraulic system  reached approximately 3 000 psi. The computer logs were not entirely clear but  showed that just before the accident the pressure was no more than about 1 600  psi. Why the plug did not fail during mining  and how a plug with most of its  threads not engaged only dripped slowly when under pressure both remain  undetermined. The accident occured during the excavation of an 11 mi long by  approximately 12 ft diameter tunnel. Excavation had been completed from the  portal to about 8 900 ft using a conventional rotary boring machine and drill  and blast methods. A digger shield-type tunnel boring machine was then  launched and had evacuated approximately 525 additional feet. The digger  shield TBM  built by CTS  Inc.  specifically for this project  utilizes an  excavator arm with a tooth attachment on its end to dig at the tunnel face.  Underneath the tooth is a flat shovel attachment or paddle that the operator  uses to pull muck onto the lower steel apron of the shield and onto the  conveyor belt. On each side of the arm are hydraulics that provide vertical  motion for the boom. On the upper part of each cylinder  angled outwards about  45 degrees are two ports for the hydraulic connections  one on each end.  Mirroring these ports  facing downward and outward  are unused threaded ports  that are plugged with 1.5 in. hex-head screws in steel plugs. When the  operator is mucking  the boom is pulled back toward him so that at the end of  the pull  the cylinder on his side is approximately 1 ft to his left. In the  fully down position  the front plug is about even with the operators left  joystick  both in height and position. There were no witnesses to the accident  and no citations were issued as a result of this investigation                  ",

The  light pole was a plastic pipe with two lights  4 square ft  held 3 ft apart  and angled out to a total width of about 76 ins. It weighed approximately 125  pounds  and its center of gravity was estimated to have been about 9.5 ft from  the bottom. Two brackets made from angle iron had been welded to the  guardrail. One bracket was at approximately 29 ins. above the ground  and the  other was at approximately 53 ins. above the ground. Two holes were drilled  into each bracket to accommodate a U-bolt to hold the light pole in place.  Employee #1  and a coworker  lifted the light pole up into place  and Employee  #1 installed the upper U-bolt. The bottom of the pole was on the outside of a  piece of electrical conduit. The pole had to be lifted up over the conduit so  the wiring could be attached. Employee #1's supervisor told Employee #1 and  his coworker to wait while the supervisor got some wood blocks to rest the  pole on  in order to raise the pole into the proper position before attaching  the lower U-bolt. While the supervisor was gone  the coworker attempted to  lift the light pole up and over the conduit  so that it would rest in between  the conduit and the wall. The coworker used a 4 ft crowbar to lift the pole up  at its base. The coworker held the pole with one hand and held the crowbar  with the other. Employee #1 was reaching out over the coworker's shoulder to  give him room to work and was holding the pole with one hand to steady it.  Employee #1 did not have control of the pole. Each employee thought the other  was in control of the top-heavy light pole. When the coworker pried the pole  up  it rotated counter-clockwise around the upper bracket. Employee #1's right  thumb was caught between the pole and the upper rail of the guardrail.  Employee #1 suffered an avulsion (skin torn off to the skeleton) to the pad of  his right thumb. He underwent surgery to amputate a portion of the right  thumb. This accident was caused by the misjudgment of a hazardous situation   specifically  attempting to use a crowbar to lift a tall  top-heavy light  pole.

Their assignment was to demolish an old   leaning cinder block wall that was approximately 7 feet high by 50 feet long.  Coworker #1 was experienced in this type of work and had been demolishing  walls for more than 29 years. Coworker #1 was operating a skid-steer tractor  with a hydraulic breaker attachment. He removed approximately 3 feet of cinder  block from the top of the wall to confirm the presence of reinforcing steel  and reduce the height of the wall. He observed that there was both vertical  and horizontal rebar in the wall and that the wall was stable. Coworker #1  removed the soil that was exposed after removing the top of the wall. He then  removed vertical slot sections of the wall approximately 6 inches wide to  obtain an approximately 4-foot section of wall  which he then would pull over  with the skid-steer. During these procedures Coworker #1 would continually  watch the wall for any indication of instability and pull on the wall with the  skid-steer to ensure it would not tip over. He saw no indication of any  structural problems. When the wall had been reduced to approximately 4 feet  from the ground  it contained a horizontal steel reinforcing bar that needed  to be cut before Coworker #1 could pull the wall down and enable the cutting  of the vertical reinforcing steel bars. Employee #1 was cutting these  horizontal steel reinforcing bars with a hand- held portable cut-off saw. The  first 4-foot section of wall had been removed following this procedure without  a problem. Coworker #1 prepared another 4-foot section of wall in the same  way. Employee #1 cut the top horizontal rebar  and then the next horizontal  rebar below  and began to position himself to cut the next rebar below. The  next 4-foot wide section of wall suddenly toppled and fell on him. Emergency  services were called  and the Los Angeles City Fire Department responded.  Employee #1 was transported to LAC+USC Medical Center  where he was admitted  and treated for a fractured pelvis and internal injuries. The Los Angeles City  Fire Department reported this incident to Cal/OSHA at approximately 8:45 a.m.  on September 10  2013. The employer reported the incident to Cal/OSHA at 7:55  a.m. on September 11  2013  after the employer learned that Employee #1 would  be hospitalized for more than 24 hours. The Cal/OSHA investigator arrived at  the work site at approximately 9:50 a.m. on September 19  2013 and began the  investigation. The investigation determined that the vertical steel  reinforcing bars in the wall were rusted away at the base and did not hold the  wall section up the way they had in the first section. The employer did not  block or brace the next wall section before allowing Employee #1 to work  adjacent to the wall  and he was injured when the wall fell over onto him. At  the time of this report  Cal/OSHA planned to issue a serious citation T8 CCR  1735(d)(4). Demolishing Buildings. (4) During demolition  continuing  inspections shall be made as the work progresses to detect hazards resulting  from weakened or deteriorated floors or walls  or loosened material.

The workers had been at  the site on two previous occasions to expose framing members by removing  drywall and then to enclosed the subject area with plastic sheeting. Because  test results from an independent testing lab showed that mold was still  present  Employees #1 and #2 returned to the apartment unit a third time to  encapsulate the mold. Employees #1 and #2 were spraying Kilz(R) Original  Aerosol to encapsulate visible mold that was on the framing members of an  interior partition wall of the apartment unit  while inside the  plastic-enclosed containment area. The homeowner was in the kitchen area of  the apartment. Employees #1 and #2 exhausted four and one-half  13-ounce-sized  cans of the flammable aerosol within the containment area  which measured 41  inches deep by 8 feet long by 8 feet  10 inches high. They then plugged into  an electrical outlet an OmniAire 1000V HEPA air filtration machine  which was  also inside the containment area. An explosion and fire occurred  when an  ignition source was introduced inside the containment area where flammable  vapors were concentrated. Employees #1 and #2 sustained serious burns (second  and third degree) to their upper bodies and faces. They required inpatient  hospitalization for more than 24 hours. According to the manufacturer   OmniAire 1000V was an air filtering machine designed for filtering  particulates and providing negative air pressure for asbestos abatement. The  machine was listed as meeting requirements for UL (Underwriters Laboratories)  Standard UL507 for Safety for Electric Fans. The listing did not include use  in hazardous atmospheres  where flammable vapors were present. The machine had  a variable speed controller and Emerson  open-frame type fan motor. The  investigation found that the employer's IIPP (Injury and Illness Prevention  Program) lacked several required elements and that the workers were not  trained on the physical or health hazards of the Kilz(R) Original Aerosol.  Further  the improper use of listed equipment in a hazardous atmosphere caused  the explosion and fire. The employer was issued citations accordingly.          ",

The vault was located at a residential construction site in Fremont   California. According to Employee #1  who was the only witness on the day of  the accident  his immediate supervisor told him to connect cables to the  switchgear; therefore  he went to the switchgear to do the requested work.  Employee #1 opened the lid to the vault at approximately 8:30 a.m. Employee #1  placed a ladder into the vault to descend into the vault. Employee #1 stood on  the top of the switchgear and Employee #1 did not notice any vibration or  noise coming from the switchgear. This contributed to Employee #1 believing  the switchgear was not energized. Employee #1 proceeded to remove three candle  elbows for terminal conductor points or bushings on the switchgear so that  Employee #1 could begin connecting cables to the switchgear. When Employee #1  removed the third or last candle elbow  an electrical flash or large ball of  light occurred. The flash generated a loud bang. Employee #1 felt a  substantial amount of pain. Employee #1 tried to ascend the nearby ladder to  get out of the underground vault. Employee #2  who heard the loud bang  went  to help Employee #1 get out of the underground vault. Employee #3 called for  emergency assistance. The gloves worn by Employee #1 had holes/tears from the  electricity that entered/exited Employee #1's hands. The gloves were Tool  Handz PLUS Reinforced Snug-Fitting types. On the day of the accident  the  weather was sunny. There was no water in the underground vault. Employee #1  did not receive electrical safety training dealing with high voltage  equipment. Employee #1 is not certified as an electrician/electrical trainee  in the state of California. Employee #1 had never used any voltage testing  equipment to determine if conductors/equipment are energized. According to  Pacific Gas and Electric  which owns the switchgear  the accident resulted in  182 customers losing power. After the accident  Employee #1 was admitted to  Eden Medical Center in Castro Valley  California  but was later admitted to  Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose  California. Employee #1 was  admitted to both hospitals on May 13  2008. Employee #1 suffered third and  second degree burns to hands  and first degree burns to entire surface of the  face to the neck. Employee #1 also suffered temporary loss of hair on his head  and face. The employer failed to provide any electrical safety training  records for Employee #1 after the employer was given a request for safety  training records. The cause of the accident was Employee #1 performed  electrical work on energized equipment/switchgear without using proper safety  controls for energized equipment. These controls include using voltage testing  equipment before performing electrical work to determine if equipment was  energized  having only a qualified electrical worker perform work on high  voltage equipment  wearing safety gloves that are rated for voltage that may  be encountered  and following proper de-energizing provisions for work on high  voltage equipment.

The  accident was the result of poor judgment of a hazardous situation by removing  the safety straps before the load was secured.                                  ",

Employee #1 was at the bottom of a 53 ft wide by  150 ft long excavation that had a maximum depth of 37 ft. He was holding an  engineering rod so that a coworker  who was also the superintendent  could  obtain elevation measurements to determine the actual depth.

The initial collapse covered him up to his knees and he stated that  he would extricate himself using a hand shovel. Within 30 seconds  a second  collapse occurred that completely engulfed him. Employee #1 died of asphyxia.  Subsequent investigation found the upper portions of the excavation on the  west and south side were sloped. The east wall was previously excavated and  had not been sloped due to the location of the old lift station on its border.  The north side contained the ramp that that held the excavator. Causal factors  in the accident were the failure to properly apply protective  anti-cave-in  systems. This was exacerbated by vibrations caused by the excavator  which was  in use while Employee #1 was still working within the excavation. The failure  to remove the existing sewer lift station also caused the excavation to be  unstable because the slab for the building had been undermined.                 ",

These light poles  which had  been bolted onto the side of the bridge  had broken off and fallen into the  roadway after being struck during an accident earlier in the day. The weather  was warm and clear  with a temperature of 81 degrees. The work crew started  removing the poles at approximately 2:00 p.m.  after the police blocked off  the section of the road they were working in. They had three poles to remove  from this location.

Employee #1 was wearing a  harness and was secured to the platform with a lanyard  but he fell with the  platform  striking his head on the ground as he landed. He was transported by  paramedics to UCLA Harbor Medical Center  where he was diagnosed with epidural  hematoma and a temporal bone fracture  as well as multiple broken bones. He  was hospitalized for three weeks and underwent two surgeries. The equipment  overturned because the boom was extended beyond the capability of the  counterweight. Employee #1 later stated that he had operated various aerial  devices during his employment with Eli Industries  Inc.  but that he had not  received any formal training or instruction from his employer on safe  operating procedures or manufacturer's instructions and safety rules. The  employer was cited for failure to report a serious injury to the Division as  require; failure to provide aerial operator trainin;  lack of inspection and  training records; and lack of a formalized heat illness prevention program.

Employee #1 was installing  2 field bolts in his end  and Coworker #2 was wiring his end to a seat set in  a tilt up concrete wall. The wire rope sling was then released from the joist  by slackening the hoist line and letting the sling lift naturally out of the  hook  which had its keeper wired back. After setting one particular joist  the  sling would not come out of the hook because it had a twist in it. The  employee unhooked his lanyard and cooned the joist out to the sling  where he  unhooked it and radioed to Coworker #1 to drop it down to the floor so a man  could straighten it out. He then started back to the end of the joist. The  sling was straightened out before he reached the end so he radioed to Coworker  #1 something to the effect of \"highball it\". As the headache ball came up  it  struck the bottom chord of the joist and detached it from the wired end. That  end fell and struck the concrete floor.

The turnaround work involved in the accident consisted of  refractory removal inside a flue duct that was associated with the FCCU. The  work crew was moved to a new confined space area in the Duct works because the  refractory needed to be immediately removed at the location. The employer  required the workers removing refractory to work within four feet of the  leading edge associated with the 28 foot vertical fall hazard. Because of the  heavy weight of the rivet buster  the work crew traded off using the tool  until one got tired. The employee had finished using the rivet buster  and he  handed the tool to a coworker. For an unknown reason  he walked the wrong  direction into vertical flue duct section. The employee fell 28 feet onto a  staging area. The employee's supervisor did not work in the permit confined  with the workers. The employee and three coworkers were in a confined space  adjacent to the fall hazard. All the employees  including the supervisor   required for all the permitted flue duct spaces to be \"100 percent tie off\".

Her employer had been subcontracted  by the general contractor  Bechtel. This work required working on scaffolding.  Employee #1 was working on the second deck of the scaffolding  above grade   and helping Coworker #1 install insulation. The foreman  Coworker #2  was  working on a level above Employee #1. Employee #1's immediate supervisor   Coworker #3  was working at another location on site and checking on Employee  #1 approximately every 20 minutes  as needed. There was a large crew that day   with frequent supervision. Employee #1 was summoned to come down to ground  level to assist. Upon exiting the gate at the scaffold rail  Employee #1  descended the ladder. At a level of approximately 8 feet above the ground   Employee #1 lost her footing and fell. She landed on her side  striking a  standoff-supported 6-inch diameter pipe. The Hayward Fire Department responded  to a call for emergency assistance and transported Employee #1 to the  hospital  where she was admitted and treated for fractured ribs  a punctured  right lung  and bruises to her right kidney and right leg. The Hayward Fire  Department reported this event to Cal/OSHA at 9:20 p.m. on March 8  2013   leaving a message with the Cal/OSHA Division's after-hours messaging service.  The employer also attempted to report the event to Cal/OSHA but inadvertently  called the local Federal OSHA office. A Cal/OSHA representative contacted the  employer on March 11  2013. The subsequent investigation found no obvious  causal factor. Employee #1 was not carrying anything while descending the  ladder  and the scaffolding and its ladder were observed to have been properly  erected by Bechtel. The investigator's report concluded that Employee #1's  injuries appeared to have been the result of a simple error in footwork.        ",

After the briefing  the operator began operating the vehicle  without honking the horn or notifying other employees in the area that the  loader would soon be moved. The operator made approximately ten trips in a  forward and backward motion to grade the area. When the accident occurred  the  operator had gone backward farther than in the previous instances. The  employee measuring the ground was not aware that the loader was traveling in  reverse farther than in previous instances.

A stringer beam connected  each end of the trusses. Employee #1's coworkers lowered the jacks to  approximately 6 in. below the jack point at the center of the stringer beam.  Employee #1 was at the east end of the shoring table and was using a very long  breaker bat to pop the plywood from the slab. He was able to separate them  when the table fell onto the jacks.

Employee #1 was  a contractor employee leased through Clover Resource Solutions  Inc. Employee  #2 was an employee of Anderson Pump Company of Chowchilla  CA  the company  installing the pump. An elevator clamp failed  allowing a 20-foot section of  8-inch well case to fall and strike the two employees. Employee #1 suffered a  concussion. He was not hospitalized. This incident was reported on the same  day to Cal/OSHA Division by the Human Resources and Safety Director for  Anderson Pump Company. Investigation determined that a dual employer  relationship was created by contract between the primary employer  Clover  Resource Solutions  Inc.  and the secondary employer  Anderson Pump and  Machine  in accordance with the Division's P&P; C-1D. As reported  an elevator  clamp failed  allowing a 20- foot section of 8-inch well case to fall and  strike the two employees. The elevator clamp was a forged ferrous metal  clamping device for lifting 8- to 10-inch well casing. In this device  a chain  would allow for adjustment of the clamp in diameter to accommodate different  diameters and terminated in a two-fingered flange attached to a threaded rod  with nut. The fingered flange would fit into a saddle provided on the clamps  housing. Tightening the nut causes the device to clamp around the pipe   securing it for hoisting. Results of the visual inspection of the clamp  revealed a clean break of the fingers without an indication of cracking or  other indication of fatigue and failure. The threads on the adjustment rod and  nut did not show signs of deformation or galling. According to industry  sources  these clamps are common in the well drilling and service industry  although not currently in production. No requirement current or historical was  found to cause users to inspect or test these clamps for structural integrity.  Several other clamps were inspected with same results  that is  no defect was  observed. Several sources in the industry asserted they had never heard of an  elevator clamp failing. Although not conclusive  a possible explanation for  the clamp's failure was the fingers were not fully seated in the saddle   causing excessive load on the tips. Root cause of the injury event was  determined to be unforeseeable catastrophic failure of the elevator clamp. The  employer was found to have a well devised health and safety program with an  effective Injury and Illness Prevention Program  including employee training  and equipment maintenance.

To access the 20 in. pipe  he stepped from atop an 8 in. line onto the  20 in. pipe. As he did this  Employee #1 struck his head on an overhead piping  and fell approximately 24 in. to the ground. He also struck a pipe support  column in the fall and sustained an open tibia and fibula dislocation to his  left leg. Employee #1 contacted his supervisor via radio. Emergency services  were activated and emergency responders provided basic life support upon  arrival. Employee #1 was transported to a medical center for further  treatment  including surgery and was then hospitalized in excess of 24 hours.  He was wearing all required personnel protective equipment  hard hat  safety  glasses  safety boots and Nomex gloves. Employee #1 may have misjudged the  hazard of the overhead 8 in. pipe and may not have seen the pipe due the brim  of his hard hat obstructing his view  when climbing to the 20 in. pipe.         ",

He had fallen 38 ft from the roof to the hard-packed earth below the roof  opening  sustaining multiple blunt force injuries and several fractured bones.  The local rescue squad attempted to stabilize Employee #1 and transported him  to the local hospital  where he died at 5:25 p.m. on July 8  1999. There were  no eyewitnesses to the accident and the reason Employee #1 fell through the  roof opening could not be determined. He may have been distracted or forgot  that the section of roofing had been cut. Alternately  he may have been  pulling at a piece of scrap packing material and fell or stumbled onto the  section of decking covering the skylight opening.                               ",

        "text": " On May 12  2005  Employee #1  of Acorn Industrial  Inc.  was removing welds  from a 30 in. CHR pipe in a utility tunnel  so the pipe could be repositioned  and re-welded in place. The pipe was normally suspended by permanent supports  spaced throughout the tunnel  as well as by temporary \"trapeze\" supports  mounted to the ceiling and positioned to hold up the pipe where it was not  adequately held by the permanent supports during installation. In the place  where Employee #1 was working  there was no permanent support in place. On the  previous day  a separate crew had received approval from the foreman and from  Employee #1 to also remove the temporary support because this top run of pipe  had been completely fit up and tack-welded in place at two joints: the west  joint and the east joint. A subsequent inspection of the welds had revealed a  misalignment of the pipe at the west joint. To correct this  Employee #1 and  the foreman decided to remove about 18 in. of the 30 in. CHR pipe at the west  joint (including the misaligned weld)  refit the two pipe ends  and redo the  weld at this location. The pipe was manually rolled to allow access to all  portions of it  due to the close proximity to the north wall. During the  rolling of the pipe  three tack welds at the west joint cracked; they were  re-welded back in place  but they cracked again during subsequent rolling of  the pipe while the victim continued cutting the pipe at the east joint. After  the tack welds cracked the second time  the foreman and Employee #1 decided to  start over at the west joint. At this point Employee #1 had completely severed  the pipe at the east joint. The foreman told Employee #1 to check his rigging  and grind out the remaining three tack welds at the west joint with a  hand-held grinder. This would allow the crew to reposition the entire 30 in.  CHR pipe and weld it back in place. The foreman left the area to continue  layout for expansion joints in another vault  and Employee #1 and his helper  continued to work at the west joint. He ground out the three broken tack welds  while they were at the bottom of the pipe  instead of rolling the pipe to put  the tack welds in a better position. At this point  the only support for the  pipe was the permanent support  about 24 ft 4 in. away  and approximately 12  ft of the pipe extended over the support structure near the east joint. The  pipe was about 38 ft long before the removal of 18 in. at the east joint.  Employee #1 was removing the tack welds from the bottom of the pipe when it  fell  crushing his right arm against the 30 in. CHS pipe below. He suffered  injuries that required hospitalization. The temporary \"trapeze\" support would  have adequately held the pipe's weight if it had been reinstalled when the  workers realized they were going to remove the tack welds at the west joint  and completely sever the pipe at the east joint. Employee #1 had been using a  Ross \"come-a-long\" to help him shift/roll the pipe for the refit. The  \"come-a-long\" was off center and therefore not in place to support the pipe;  it could only provide offset force to shift or roll the pipe. -----             ",

His employer had been in the trade for more than 10  years and should have been knowledgeable about the safety requirements for  working around power lines  but it had not scheduled any special provisions  for this job site. The employer had apparently acknowledged the power lines  once he was on the job site and positioned the truck at the opposite end  but  Employee #1  who was in his third week with the company  was directly over the  line at the time of the accident.

Before off-loading more counterweights  they attempted to reposition the  last counterweight off-loaded. Employee #1 and a coworker set the hooks at the  end of the rigging to the counterweight lift points. Employee #1 positioned  himself between the counterweight being lifted and counterweights that were  previously off-loaded (approximately one foot of space). Employee #1 gave the  signal to the crane operator to begin tightening up the rigging to set the  hooks. The crane boom was not centered over the load and when the crane  operator began to boom up  one hook set  raising the counterweight to a height  that allowed it to slide and rotate. Employee #1 was crushed between the  counterweight being lifted and other counterweights that had been stacked  behind him. As soon as the crane operator saw what happened  he repositioned  the counterweight and emergency services were called to the scene. Employee #1  was transported to Coffeyville Regional Medical Center and was subsequently  air evacuated to St. Johns Regional Medical Center in Joplin  Missouri  where  he died from his injuries.

Part of his duties involved  the set-up and prejob inspection of the concrete pump  to ensure that debris  was not in or around the pump \"rock valve\" that was located at the bottom of  the hopper. While performing the set-up and prejob inspection of the concrete  pump  he crawled underneath the hopper and opened a trap door. Then using a  hand-held remote control  he cycled the valve so he could perform a check. He  then cycled the valve a second time. Thinking he had turned the valve off with  the remote  he placed his left hand through the opening when the valve cycled.  Employee #1's left hand became pinned and was crushed. After the valve cycled  back  Employee #1 was then able to free himself. Emergency services were  contacted and Employee #1 was transported to UC Davis Medical Center  in  Sacramento  California.

The contractor was replacing an existing line of 954 MCM ACSR conductors from  the North tower to the substation with a new line of 2034 MCM ACSR conductors.  The new conductors had been connected at the North tower and were being  secured at an A-frame in the substation. The general supervisor had directed  the removal of all protective grounding jumpers from the North and South  towers. Two employees were in a personnel platform on a crane. A bonding  jumper was installed between the phase conductor and the platform on the  crane. The truck crane was not adequately grounded to earth. The phase  conductor was grounded through the hoist  but no other protective grounds were  installed. The two employees had just completed splicing the ends of the three  phase conductors from the North tower to their counterparts on the A-frame.  Each of the phase conductors was held by a 2.7-metric-ton hoist. The employees  had clipped in the first phase conductor. One of them then started to remove  the hoist from that conductor and received an electric shock. The employee let  go of the hoist  but grabbed it again and gave it a big push to force it away  from the conductor. When the hoist separated from the conductor  the employee  was electrocuted. The power line on which the employees were working was  deenergized; however  a 500-kilovolt overhead power line ran parallel to it. A  test on the lower voltage line after the accident found it to be energized at  7000 volts through induction from the higher voltage line.                      ",

        "text": " At approximately 10:05 a.m. on March 8  2013  Employee #1  a carpentry crew  leader employed by HAR Construction Co. LLC  was working at a construction  site where a new six-story apartment complex with two stories of underground  parking was being built. He was wearing a hard hat and had on his carpenter's  belt. He was walking on a wood platform on the fourth floor of the building  under construction. The platform measured 9 feet 11 inches long by 47.5 inches  wide and was not guarded on the north  south  and east sides. A gust of wind  or some other factor caused Employee #1 to fall from the platform. He fell to  a concrete floor area on the third floor below  a distance of approximately 10  feet 8.25 inches. He apparently did not strike or hit anything as he fell. He  landed between two 2-foot by 4-foot wood braces that were positioned 5 feet  1.25 inches apart on the third floor. He landed face down  striking his head  on the concrete floor approximately 4 feet 4 inches from a wood framed wall.  Employee #1's fall was witnessed by Coworker #1  who was working on the third  floor. Coworker #1 went to Employee #1 and got no response. He then went and  got help from one or more others at the work site. When they returned   Employee #1 was still unresponsive. There was a considerable amount of blood  pooled around Employee #1's head. Rescue personnel were called  and when they  arrived  they pronounced Employee #1 dead at the scene from massive head  trauma. The subsequent investigation established that Clark Builders Group LLC  was the general contractor for this work project. One of the subcontractors  was Agility Construction LLC  which had the framing contract. Agility  subcontracted all of the framing work to HAR Construction Co. LLC  with which  Agility had worked numerous times on other job sites. Agility's project  manager had responsibility for overseeing the labor (the HAR employees) and  the ordering and delivery of all the building materials. The project manager  for Agility did the majority of the lay out and mark up of the different units  on each floor. Agility dealt directly with the Clark Builders Group officials.  HAR Construction Co. LLC had 52 employees working at this site. They had been  at the site since early January 2013. There were two foremen  two crew  leaders  16 carpenters  and 32 skilled laborers. Their employees were working  all over the large project. Employee #1 had been one of the two carpentry crew  leaders. On other jobs he had been a foreman. He had worked for HAR  Construction Co. for 8 years. As a crew leader he checked on the four groups  of carpenters working throughout the project. He used a chalk line to lay out  where the walls were to be constructed. He also assisted in undoing the  rigging on the different loads of materials and equipment lifted up and onto  the different floor levels by the tower crane. Prior to his fall  Employee #1  was up on the fourth floor conducting various work duties. During the  investigation  Coworker #1 stated that he believed it was approximately 9:00  a.m. when Employee #1  while still up on the fourth floor  walked over near  the work area on the third floor where Coworker #1 was working. Coworker #1  told Employee #1 that they needed one more 2-foot by 4-foot piece of lumber  and that there were no more on the third floor. Employee #1 went back to an  area on the fourth floor that was enclosed by guardrails and picked up a piece  of lumber from a lumber stack. He then handed the lumber down to Coworker #1  from either inside or outside the guarded area. After Coworker #1 took the  lumber  Employee #1 told Coworker #1 he was going to come down to the third  floor using the job-made wood ladder that was at the east end of the platform  nearby. Within seconds Employee #1 fell from the south side of the fourth  floor platform to a concrete floor area on the third floor.

The operator was lowering  the axle housing to be threaded into the coupling on the housing section below  it when the axle housing section became caught on a collar inside the  outermost water pipe.

While the load was being swung out and delivered by the crane to  Employee #1 to land and connect at the second level  one of the angles  (approximately 64 in. long with a 5 in. by 5 in. corner) started to slide out  of its metal rope sling 3/8 choker. This angle then slid toward Employee #1  who tried to fend this metal angle away so that he would not get hit. The  angle  weighing approximately 86 lbs  nudged this employee off balance  and he  fell off the beam on which he was standing. He was able to grab on to the beam  with his left arm  and he hung on for a couple of seconds. Eventually   however  Employee #1 could not hang on to the beam with only his left arm.  Employee #1 fell down from that level  about 10 to 14 feet  facing downward  towards his left side. When he landed on the ground  Employee #1 was able to  turn around immediately in order for him to attempt to get up from the ground.  A metal angle then fell  hitting Employee #1 on the head; he lost  consciousness. He was hospitalized with unspecified fractures.                  ",

Employee #1 was working  alone  removing safety brackets  with an acetylene torch (oxy-acetylene)  from  the column supporting the trellis. The trellis brackets were about 18 ft above  the ground. Employee #1 noticed that the steel tube connecting the trellis to  the northwest column was not straight. Employee #1 was the foreman responsible  for safety and the proper installation of the trellis at the site. Employee #1  decided that the welded connection at the northwest column was unacceptable  and had to be repaired. Employee #1 used an acetylene torch (oxy-acetylene) to  cut the bottom weld on the steel tube connecting the trellis to the northwest  column. When the bottom weld was cut  the weight of the trellis was too great  for the remaining welds to support the 15 000 pound structural steel trellis.  This action allowed the northwest corner of the trellis to fall approximately  two ft and trap Employee #1 between the trellis and the wall. Apparently  the  structural design of the structure was modified by an unqualified foreman   when he removed structural welds. This caused the remaining welds to fail  under the load  and allow the structure to fall. Employee #1 was transported  to the hospital  and he was admitted for over 24 hours  for chest and facial  fractures.                                                                      ",

The employee asked a coworker to  go to the first floor below and put caution tape barricade on the area where  the stonecutters will be cutting the floor so that no other employees would be  exposed to the falling debris hazards. According to Employee #1  the  supervisor did not inform him that there was a floor opening in that work  place vicinity  nor did he inform him to wear fall protection.

He climbed a metal extension ladder that had been provided by the  customer and placed against the 10-foot tall metal water tank. The employee  ascended the metal ladder to conduct an electrical test on a malfunctioning  110-volt tank float. He grounded himself out against the metal tank and  received an electrical shock. He fell approximately 5 feet to the ground   landing on his back. He was transported to Twin Cities Hospital  Templeton   CA  and subsequently transported by ambulance to Sierra Vista Hospital  San  Luis Obispo  CA. The employee was determined to have suffered a burst fracture  of T9 vertebra. This accident was reported to Cal/OSHA Division on July 25   2011  2 days 20 hours and 55 minutes after the incident. The Division  conducted an opening conference on September 1  2011  at 9:17 a.m.  Investigation determined that the employer  in the business of water well  drilling  repair  and maintenance in the local area  had provided the employee  a fiberglass extension ladder and rubber gloves to use when testing live  circuits. The employee  however  did not use this equipment. Instead  he used  the customer-provided metal extension ladder  which had no identifiable  markings. The employer received a general citation under Title 8 Calif. Code  of Regulations 3276(f)(2).                                                      ",

They worked from the scaffold to  remove old stucco from the exterior of the front part of the single-family  dwelling house. They also installed two windows  a new door  and were supposed  to paint the front of the house. The employee was on the scaffold painting  from the upper level. Other coworkers were present at the site. At  approximately 2:15 p.m.  the property owner was present at home and heard  something dropped. She went out to investigate. She saw the employee leaning  up against a coworker by the garage door area. The property owner called the  emergency services. One of the employees had contacted the employer about the  incident. Meanwhile  coworkers were starting to move the employee. When the  employer arrived at the jobsite  he and his workers picked-up the employee and  placed him in back seat of a car. Just prior to leaving the jobsite  the  ambulance responded to the jobsite and the employee was given medical  attention. The employee was taken to San Francisco General Hospital. He was  treated for head trauma and was in a coma for approximately a month. Surgery  was performed to relieve pressure built-up inside the skull and to remove  blood clots. His condition slowly improved  and he stayed in the hospital for  another four months. He was transferred to Laguna Honda Hospital in September   where he spent time for recovery.

He was working from a  6-foot A-frame ladder. The ladder was set up in a room where the carpenter was  attempting to install a large  heavy piece of plywood over ceiling framing 8  feet above the floor. The employee fell from the ladder. He was transported to  the hospital  admitted  and treated for serious head and facial fractures. He  was hospitalized for more than a month and  at the time of this report   remained in a skilled nursing facility. The employee's fall was reported to  the employer  the project's General Contractor  at 1:07 p.m. on March 14   2013. Cal/OSHA opened its investigation on April 4  2013. (The investigation  report did not indicate when Cal/OSHA was notified  and the reason for the  three-week delay in opening this case was unclear.) Cal/OSHA's investigation  determined that the ladder involved was a Special Duty Type 1AA  2011 Werner  Co. 6-foot A-frame ladder with a 375-pound load capacity. The investigation  report concluded that the employee's fall was caused by the employer failing  to prohibit employees from carrying equipment or materials which prevent the  safe use of ladders. By carrying a large  heavy piece of plywood up the  ladder  the employee appeared to have lost his balance. Serious  accident-related citations issued to the employer included: 3275(e)(15)(B)  Failing to prohibit employees from carrying materials up ladders  preventing  their safe use.

A  worker led Employee #1 and #2 to an electrical room  where Employee #1 opened  the 4 160-volt 3-phase OFC switch device. The OFC switching device contains  three separate OFC switches  one switch for each electrical phase. The OFC  device had a mechanical linkage that turns the internal fuses approximately a  .25 turn. The turning of the fuse .25 turn disconnects the fuses from their  contact points within the switch. The fuses are immersed in clear dielectric  oil  which is intended to quench any electrical arc that may occur when the  fuses are connected or disconnected from an energized electrical source. The  three OFC switches are opened and closed simultaneously through the use of the  mechanical linkage. Electrical power was still energized to the incoming  (line) side of the fuse contact point within the OFC switches. Opening the OFC  switch device deenergized the electrical power to the OFC fuses and to a  malfunctioning transformer powered by the OFC switch device. As part of the  troubleshooting process Employee #1 checked the fuses in the OFC switches. One  fuse holder was removed completely and visually inspected. Employee #1 saw  that the fuse was blown and noted that the dielectric oil within the switch  was dark in color.

        "text": " Employee #1 along with his foreman was in the process of landing a piece of  tower structure to be added to the top of this communications tower  standing  approximately 200 to 300 feet above ground level. While the two men were in  the process of moving the section into position to be bolted into place  the  hoist operator set the dogs on the hoist to hold the load in place while he  dealt with a distraction that had just come up. Just after the hoist dogs had  been set  and as the hoist operator was dealing with the distraction  the  hoist line slipped. The hoist operator was close enough to the hoist to apply  the hoist brake  thereby catching the structure before it fell to the ground.  The sudden impact of the load on the hoist line caused the gin pole attachment  mounted on the side tower near the top of the structure to break lose from the  tower  while at the same time the tower section on the end of the hoist line  swung into the side of the tower  causing the tower to tremble. At this time   Employee #1 starts coming out of the tower  supposedly thinking the tower was  about to come down. While coming down out of the tower  Employee #1 falls off  the tower some 200 plus feet to the ground. The job foreman also comes off the  tower with no problem or injury. Both men were wearing the required fall  protection equipment and were experienced tower erectors. The hoist operator  was both the president of the company as well as the hoist operator  with  several years experience in both hoist operation as well as tower erection.  The hoist operator acknowledged that he had inspected  or at least looked over  the hoisting equipment prior to his using the equipment. The owner of the  hoist provided literature illustrating that the hoist had just been overhauled  immediately prior to being brought to and used on this job. The hoisting  equipment  including both the hoist and the gin pole  were already attached to  the tower when this company arrived on site to replace a previous erection  company who was removed from the job by the owner of the tower. The  distraction listed above was caused by the previous company arriving on the  job site only to see the Diamond C Company working on this tower. They were  using the hoisting equipment without their knowledge of the change made by the  tower owner and general contractor of the tower construction. It was concluded  that the accident was caused by the hoist operator using the hoist brake to  arrest the fall of the tower section  which caused the gin pole to break lose  from the tower and the structure on the end of the hoist line to swing into  the tower  sending strong vibrations throughout the tower  causing Employee #1  to think that the tower was about to come down. This tower was still standing  several days after the accident as well as at the time the CSHO returned to  the job site to finish the onsite investigation a day or so after the  accident.

However  the two  employees did not know that one of the cubicles remained energized from  another source of electric energy.

He did this because the machine was scheduled to be picked up later  that day. The worker was riding in the boom basket as the lift went down the  paved driveway. The driveway had an approximately 20 percent grade. The boom  basket was in a fully lowered boom position. He had the machine running in its  forward direction  facing downhill  with the basket trailing. As he moved down  the hill  the machine began to gain speed. When he tried to stop the machine   it went into a skid. He then intentionally steered the machine into a tree in  order to bring it to a stop. When the machine hit the tree  it rolled over and  came to a rest across the driveway. The worker was not secured to the basket  by any means  but he physically held on to the basket railing as it hit the  ground beside the driveway.

The project consisted of constructing new floors at the top of the  existing Westlake Garage  west of the Macy Department Store  at Westfield  Montgomery Mall. The construction was in its early stages. The construction of  new floors required erection of a tower crane in the middle of the existing  garage. An opening was therefore being made by removing two existing double  tees on the roof and another two at the second floor  which would provide an  opening for the crane. The two double tees on the roof were safely removed by  a mobile crane and stored at a nearby location within the project site. The  roof double tees were not to be reused. However  the two double tees at the  second floor were to be reused  and  therefore  were to be removed by  hydraulic jacking and skating method. One of the double tees at the second  floor was successfully removed.

The two tanks and three leach pipes are connected in a  series. The plant could not be shut down while work was being performed.  Coworker #1 and the client's employee discussed placement of submersible pump  in the second septic holding tank coming away from plant.

Employee #1 was operating a Snorkel Model  Number S1930 scissor lift to pull and staple wiring on the ceiling of the  hallway on the ground floor. The wires were to be later attached to an  overhead lighting fixture. Employee #1 was in the scissor lift  at a height of  approximately 15 feet and in the vicinity of a junction box located near the  ceiling. He had to lean over past the railing to reach the junction box that  was approximately two feet away. The platform of the scissor lift suddenly  elevated  and Employee #1 was pinned between its top rail and a wooden floor  joist. Another worker saw that Employee #1 was in trouble and came to his aid.  The general contractor operated another scissor lift to reach Employee #1 and  then brought him to the ground. Emergency services were called  and the San  Francisco Fire Department responded. Employee #1 was taken to San Francisco  General Hospital by ambulance. He was hospitalized and treated for fractured  ribs  a punctured lung  lacerations to his liver and pancreas  and a bruised  prostate. Employee #1's spleen was removed. The San Francisco Fire Department  but not the employer reported the incident to Cal/OSHA. The general  contractor  Employee #1  the employer  a coworker  and another employee were  interviewed during the course of the investigation. The employer was cited for  failure to train  which is a general violation. A Cal/OSHA regulation required  employees to be instructed in the safe use of the work platform  and Employee  #1 was not instructed before operating the scissor lift for the first time.  The violation was classified as \"general\" because the Division could not  establish substantial probability. The employer was also cited for not  notifying the Division about the incident. Other violations were observed  and  the employer was cited accordingly. The Division ordered the scissor lift to  be preserved on the day of the inspection. A forensics company was contracted  by Employee #1's attorney to evaluate the lift. During the examination  the  scissor lift had not demonstrated any unintended movement.

The  project involved the construction of two additional classroom buildings and a  theater at a high school. On the day of the accident  Employee #1 was assigned  by his supervisor to remove a bent plate from a beam on the second floor of  one of the structures. In an interview  Employee #1 stated that  prior to the  accident  he was cutting the welds on the plate. Employee #1 could not remove  the last weld  so he decided to go down to get a smaller disc cutter. Employee  #1 said he was two feet down the ladder when he removed his lanyard connection  from a steel post. At that point  Employee #1 heard a loud crack. A steel  plate hit him  and he fell to the ground below  a fall distance of 17 feet.  Employee #1 suffered thoracic vertebral fractures as a result of the accident.  He was taken to San Francisco General Hospital for evaluation and treatment.  He was admitted at 2:37 p.m. on August 16  2010  and was discharged at 8:40  p.m. on August 17  2010.

Employee #1 was assigned to operate a jackhammer where needed  after the milling machine conducted its passes over the bridge. Employee #1  was also assigned the task of maintaining the traffic pattern for the  equipment. The traffic pattern was set up by the worksite foreman  the  Bobcat/Trimmer operator  and Employee #1  working in coordination with the  Connecticut State Police. Once the traffic pattern was established  the  milling machine  a sweeper  a Bobcat machine and a trimming machine were moved  over into the closed portion of the southbound Route 9 highway. The plan of  work for the evening was to mill the pavement of the bridge surface from zero  on the north side of the bridge  to 1.5 inches over the bridge surface and  back to zero on the south side of the bridge. The sweeper operator positioned  the sweeper behind the milling machine and waited for the milling machine to  conduct its first pass over the bridge. The Bobcat/Trimmer operator drove a  water truck into the traffic pattern and parked the truck. The Bobcat/Trimmer  operator then accessed the Trimming machine and waited for the milling machine  to conduct its first pass over the bridge. There were also several dump trucks  on site  and they were lined up just south of the bridge along the east side  of the highway. The milling machine conducted its first pass over the bridge  along the far east side of the bridge in a north to south direction or in the  same direction as traffic along the southbound side of the highway. The first  pass over the bridge was a full milling pass measuring 7 feet 2 inches wide.  The sweeper ran or operated behind the milling machine. The milling machine  backed up and repositioned itself on the north side of the bridge to perform  its second pass just west of the first pass. While the milling machine backed  up and repositioned itself  the sweeper also backed up onto the north side of  the bridge. The second pass was approximately 6 feet 6 inches wide with the  overlap. While the milling machine was performing its second pass over the  bridge the trimming machine was operating in a south to north direction along  the far east side of the bridge where the milling machine conducted its first  pass over the bridge in order to mill the edge or the bridge near the concrete  retaining wall of the bridge. The sweeper followed the milling machine over  the bridge during the second pass over the bridge. The milling machine back up  and repositioned itself on the north side of the bridge to perform its third  pass over the bridge just west of the second pass. At this time the sweeper  machine was full of material and pulled farther north of the bridge to prepare  to dump into the dump truck that was positioned on the north side of the  bridge. While backing up the milling machine over the bridge to conduct the  fourth pass  the milling machine ground man located on the west side of the  milling machine was asked by Employee #1 if they needed the traffic cones  moved farther west slightly into the driving lane of the highway. The milling  machine ground man told Employee #1 not to move the traffic cones since they  were only going to complete a half pass. Employee #1 was located on the east  side of the machine and asked the milling machine operator if the traffic  cones should be moved. The milling machine operator also informed Employee #1  not to move the traffic cones.

The  injured Employee #1  an apprentice elevator mechanic was working with a  foreman and mechanic for the installation of a new hydraulic elevator into a 3  level office building. There were two personnel assigned to the crew for this  installation. At the time of the accident the foreman was at the bottom of the  hoist way about 19 feet below the landing where Employee #1 was working near  the hoist way opening on level 2. Prior to and at the time of the accident   the workers were in the process of lowering equipment  tools and materials  into the hoist way by use of a pulley which the foreman had installed at the  top of the hoist way and a capstan motor installed at the base of the shaft  with a hoist line and shackle. The materials to be lowered included six   sixteen-foot metal elevator rails. Employee #1 would attach the end of the  hoist line to the leading end of the rail through a hole in the rail end and  then manually lift the trailing end and walk it forward while straddling it as  the foreman ran the capstan motor until the trailing end cleared the landing  at the 2nd floor level  at which point the rail was then lowered down to the  bottom. Employee #1 experienced difficulty untying the first rail they lowered  because the shackle in the end of the 16 ft. rail was 3 ft. below the edge of  the hoist way 2nd level landing when it reached bottom  requiring him to reach  down into the hoist way to disconnect it. He next utilized some 1/2 inch nylon  rope to extend the hoist line length and lifted four more rails in this manner  which allowed him to disconnect without leaning into the hoist way  however he  was not wearing or using the available fall protection equipment during these  lifts. The nylon rope apparently loosened while lifting the final rail  but  this occurred before the trailing end had cleared the edge of the 2nd level  landing. Employee #1 was about 3 feet from the edge of the hoist way when the  leading end of the rail began to drop downward and the trailing end began to  shift back into the 2nd level landing. Eventually the trailing end being  carried by Employee #1 levered upward as the leading end fell into the hoist  way  catapulting him forward and into the hoist way. Employee #1 landed on the  concrete floor below  suffering multiple injuries including: broken vertebrae   broken left ankle  broken left tibia and fibula  and a broken pelvis. The  foreman for this crew failed to ensure that Employee #1 or himself were using  fall protection where exposed to potential falls into the elevator hoist way.  The Division concluded that this accident was preventable had the provisions  of T8 CCR 1670(a) been followed to ensure the use of fall protection and a  serious accident-related violation was issued.

Employee #1 was in charge of attending to a kettle that  contained hot tar  while most of the coworkers were on the roof. The kettle  was a portable piece of equipment that is equipped with LPG fueled heaters.  Solid pieces of tar that were delivered to the jobsite are loaded into the  kettle and heated into a liquid tar. It took approximately three hours for the  solid tar to become liquid and during this process  the motor and pump on the  kettle operated in order to circulate the tar through the kettle. The  liquefied tar was pumped through a closed piping system to the roof area. When  the pump was not delivering hot tar to the roof area  the pump continues to  operate and a diverter was used to recirculate the hot tar through the kettle.  This recirculation was conducted in order to prevent the tar from settling on  the bottom of the kettle. The diverter valve was manually operated through an  accessible handle located on the valve and diverted the hot tar between  circulating through the kettle and up to the roof area  dependent on the needs  of the workers. As the kettle was in recirculation mode  without notifying  Employee #1  one of the coworkers walked over to the pipe that supplies tar to  the roof and pulled on a rope that was connected to the diverter valve. This  action should have allowed the hot tar in the kettle to be diverted to the  roof; however  the motor shut down. Employee #1 was thought that there was a  clog in the pipe and used an LPG fueled fired heating torch to heat the pipe  between the kettle and the roof pipe.

Soltek Pacific Construction was constructing cement  columns as part of Masonry wall construction at this site. Employee #1 was  working as a carpenter who was assembling and disassembling cement forms used  in the construction of columns and other cement objects. Employee #1 stated  that prior to climbing on to the EZ Commercial Tower Scaffold  he checked and  found a green tag with an authorization signature dated September 4  2012  indicating the work platform had been inspected and access was permitted under  Balfour-Beatty's safety program. At the time of the incident Employee #1 was  standing on scaffold planking at column number seven in building number four   stripping formwork from a cast in place column. Employee #1 reported to have  been using a fifty-six inch long \"Burk\" pry bar to pry off a two-inch by  four-inch wood ledger from cement column number seven that it was attached to.  Employee # 1 was standing on two scaffold planks that were part of an EZ  Commercial Tower Scaffold owned by New Dimension Masonry Inc. The scaffold  planks were supported by a bearer bar that was positioned approximately  two-inches from column number seven  the scaffold planks overlapped the bearer  bar by approximately two inches. A coworker stated that he was working above  Employee #1  on Column number seven. The coworker stated that he saw Employee  #1 make a quick motion with the Burk Bar to pry the wood ledger off the column  and at the same time he saw the two scaffold planks that Employee #1 was  standing on slide right out from under Employee #1's feet. The coworker saw  Employee #1 fall. Employee #1 struck a pipe that was sticking out of the wall  while falling approximately twenty-nine feet to the cement floor below. The  coworker yelled that Employee #1 fell and for someone to call 911.while he  went to Employee #1's aid. A review of the EZ Scaffold Commercial Tower  Scaffold safety and installation manual found on page forty  section B   labeled \"Construction\" that the manufacturer stated that  \"All scaffold planks  must extend six inches beyond and no more than twelve inches past the bearer  bar and that all overhead scaffold planks must overlap a minimum of six  inches. Additional review of the instruction manual found no directions   instructions or authorizations allowing for a deviation of the six-inch  overlap requirement for scaffold planks. A New Dimension Masonry employee  stated that a representative of Balfour Beatty requested the tower scaffold be  left in place for use by other trades after New Dimension Masonry was done  with its use and was ready to disassemble it. Balfour Beatty's Site specific  Safety Program required that a qualified person inspect the scaffold on a  daily basis. When the scaffold was found safe  the qualified person was to  sign and date a green tag indicating the scaffold was safe to use. Employees  of New Dimension Masonry were the competent persons who conducted the daily  safety inspections of the scaffold and would sign/date a green tag indicating  the scaffold was safe to use. Employee #1 and the coworker stated that a green  tag with the current date was in place at the scaffold stairwell on the day of  the incident. Balfour Beatty's employees conducted daily safety inspections of  the work site. Employee #1 fell approximately twenty-nine feet from scaffold  to the floor below.

The collapsing trench pushed Employee #2 against a  trench shield in a shored section of the trench  burying him to his thighs.  Emergency personnel were called  and at 1:45 p.m. the Los Angeles Fire  Department dispatched fire and rescue resources to the site. At 1:55 p.m.  the  Los Angeles Fire Department notified Cal/OSHA. Fire Department personnel  exposed Employee #1's head and determined that he was dead. They began a  recovery operation that lasted 7 hours. Employee#2 was extricated from the  trench and transported by air ambulance to UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center   where he was hospitalized and treated for trauma to his legs  including one or  more leg fractures. Cal/OSHA  which immediately responded after being notified  by the Los Angeles Fire Department  arrived at the site at 3:00 p.m. Cal/OSHA  contacted the employer  fulfilling reporting requirements. Cal/OSHA's  investigation determined that Employees #1 and #2 were working in a 14-foot  deep trench that was not protected from a cave-in by any protective systems or  procedures. The trench in which they were working had caved in two hours  earlier. When the second cave-in occurred  killing Employee #1 and seriously  injuring Employee #1  their supervisor was in the immediate area and was in  possession of engineering documents indicating that employees must not work in  the unprotected sections of the trench. ACCIDENT RELATED-SERIOUS CITATIONS  ISSUED: Cal/OSHA planned to issue a Willful Serious Accident Related citation  for a violation of T8 CCR 1541.1(a)  a serious citation for a violation of  1541(k)  and a serious citation for a violation of 1509(a).

Employee #1 had  successfully installed the first of three meters on a bank of meter switchgear  that was vertically arrayed. The meters were in a three-phase 480-volt system.  At 1:40 p.m.  he had scanned the first meter  using an MBLink mobile handheld  device to record that it was operable. Employee #1 next removed the second  meter and seated its replacement. He was placing the lock ring around that  meter  when he heard a humming sound. He immediately turned away  and an arc  flash occurred. It was the result of a phase-to-phase fault. He was thrown  back by the force of the blast. Because he had turned away upon initially  hearing the humming sound just before the arc flash  he sustained burns to his  ear and cheek. He watched as the electrical system continued to burn and arc.  He used his fire extinguisher to mitigate the ensuing fire before the  Fullerton fire department arrived on the scene. Employee #1 was wearing full  personal protective equipment (PPE) for electrical work: rubber insulated  gloves  leather gloves  long sleeve shirt  face shield  and safety glasses.  The arc flash resulting from the fault caused Employee #1 to sustain second-  and third-degree burn to the right side of his face and ear. He was treated at  an emergency room and released the same day. Employee #1 was a journeyman  electrician with IBEW local 47. He had over 10 years of experience working as  an electrician. He had worked full-time for the company replacing Edison  meters since July 2011. The company had written procedures for replacing the  meters  and they provided documentation of training the employee on those  written procedures. Further  Employee #1 confirmed that he was following those  procedures when the accident occurred. During the course of the worker's  employment  he had installed 35 to 40 new meters per workday without incident.  On the date of the accident  the employee had successfully completed 38  installations  with only two remaining for the day. It is unknown exactly what  caused the fault that resulted in the arc flash. The arc flash may  however   have been attributed to any of the following conditions: 1) the meter was  defective  2) a demand was placed on the load side during installation that  caused a surge  3) the meter was not properly seated into the meter socket  or  4) the employee made contact with the energized components with either a tool  or the meter's lock ring.

One of the workers was on the ground operating the Hydraulic Power Systems   Inc.  hoisting unit. Two workers were at a height of approximately 1 800 ft on  the tower  removing the equipment. Once it was free  they would connect it to  a 5/8-in. nylon rope  and the hoist operator would lower it to about the 600  ft level of the tower  where Employee #1 was located. He was connected to and  suspended by a 1/2 in. wire rope hoist line. Once the equipment reached him   he would connect it to the hoist line  and the hoist operator would then lower  him and the equipment to the ground. Employee #1 would disconnect the  equipment  and then be raised back up to wait for the next load. During the  course of the operations  Employee #1 was being raised when the nylon rope  broke. The approximately 100 lb equipment attached to the rope fell from  approximately 1 800 ft  as did a headache ball that was also attached to the  rope. The broken end of the rope became tangled on the rigging block that was  on top of the tower. This caused the nylon rope to suddenly stop  and the  shock caused the it to break again at a point just above the headache ball.  The nylon rope  headache ball  and equipment fell until they struck Employee  #1 on the hoist line. He was connected to the line with a CM chain repair link  that was not designed to be part of a personal fall protection or positioning  system. The link separated and Employee #1 fell about 550 ft to the ground. He  was killed. Subsequent investigation revealed several problems with the  hoisting system: the rigging  hoist line  and slings that were used to raise  personnel had not been installed with a 10:1 safety factor; Employee #1 was on  the hoist line while another load was suspended from the same hoist unit;  Employee #1 connected his fall protection/positioning device to a shackle  above the hook rather than using a lanyard that had been placed directly on  the hook; and no anti-two-blocking device was installed on the personnel  hoisting line. It was believed that the nylon rope was cut by the wire rope  where they both passed through the same double-block rigging device at  approximately 500 ft on the tower.

The other end remained connected to a beam above the  main floor. The free end of the truss then swung downward about 11 ft to the  floor  striking Employee #1 as he was walking under it.

The  containment was constructed of concrete and formed in the shape of a large  cylinder. The trough system was constructed of steel and rested on 5.75 ft  steel supports above the bottom interior surface of the containment. The steel  supports were mounted to the surface of the concrete containment with 6 in.  bolts and epoxy adhesive. The trough system was designed to transport the flow  of water to the containment. The employees were in the process of placing the  trough onto the supports  and tack weld an uneven section of trough to a  neighboring section of trough. It was standard procedure for an employee to  stand on a trough section which was uneven in order to level it with the  neighboring trough system  while another employee tack welded the two troughs  systems together. This procedure exposed Employee #1 to a fall of 5.75 ft. The  employer had written fall protection policy that requires employees to be tied  off when working at a level of 6 ft or higher. As Employee #1 stood upon the  uneven trough  a top bolt to a steel support loosened and pulled out allowing  another section of the trough to fall.

Two 10 ft  tall by 20 ft long trench boxes  with 44 in. spreaders  were in use. The  initial excavation was 20 ft deep  but an excavator using a 32 in. shovel had  then dug between the trench boxes to a depth of approximately 22 ft. The  result was that the trench boxes sat on two \"shelves \" each approximately 2 to  3 ft in height. A section of soil  approximately 18 in. wide by 2 to 3 ft deep  by 3 ft long  caved into the trench from the 3 ft high shelf on which the  trench boxes were positioned. The dirt struck Employee #1 on the back of his  legs  knocking him down to his knees. The coworker acting as top man saw the  cave-in and alerted the excavator operator  the foreman  and the loader  operator. The coworker and the loader operator climbed down into the trench  and began shoveling dirt off Employee #1. As they did this  a second cave-in  occurred  coming from the same area. The dirt flowed from under the trench  box  covering Employee #1 over the back of his legs. The two coworkers  continued to shovel for another five minutes and had nearly cleared enough  soil to free him when a third substantial collapse occurred  coming from under  the trench box and from around the front of the east end of the trench boxes.  This collapse engulfed Employee #1 up to his waist and knocked down the  coworker who had witnessed the first cave-in  covering the coworker's legs in  soil  and trapping him as well. The foreman was now also down in the trench   shoveling dirt off the coworker. He was eventually able to pull himself free  of the collapsed soil and then left the trench  exhausted from shoveling.  Rescue personnel from the Sommers Fire Department arrived at the site and took  over rescue operations. A fourth cave-in occurred that replaced the soil  previously removed. The Summers Fire Department called in the SRT Units from  Lake County  IL  for assistance. During the rescue attempt  which lasted over  an hour  soil continued to flow into the trench from beneath the trench box on  the north side and from around the front (east) side of the open-ended trench  box. No protective shielding was in place east of the trench box. The soil was  sloped from about the 15 ft depth level back up to the excavator position   which was about 15 ft to the east. At approximately 10:30 a.m.  a significant  collapse occurred that fully engulfed Employee #1; he died of mechanical  asphyxiation. In a preliminary assessment of the protective measures taken   the top of Employee #1's head was found to be 23 ft below the top of the  trench box. His knees were measured at approximately 25 ft from the top of the  trench box. Tabulated data provided on the trench boxes indicated that they  could be used up to a depth of 35 ft for class A soil  22 ft for class B soil   and 17 ft for class C soil. Preliminary soil classification performed in the  field identified the soil as class C. Clay soil comprised approximately the  top 8 ft  with sand (a class C soil) comprising the bottom layer. Clay soil  located over a C sand soil was classified as a class C soil. Soil samples were  taken from three different locations  including soil excavated during the  recovery. The recovery effort took approximately 13 hours. The top man later  stated that he saw the fissure occur and tried to warn Employee #1 of the  pending cave-in.                                                                ",

On column B-5  there was a stack of laminated top MDO (medium density overlay)  plywood  each piece measuring 4 feet by 8 feet by 14.75 inches. The stack had  been piled (long side) vertically against the column by a forklift  with  Employee #2 helping to guide the load. As Employees #1 and #2 were removing  one sheet of plywood from the stack  the stack fell toward them. Employee #1  tried to push Employee #2 out of the way  but neither escaped in time to avoid  injury. They both fell onto the concrete slab underneath the plywood pile.  Nearby workers tried to lift up the pile and failed. Single sheets had to be  removed from the pile  one at a time. Emergency services were called  and the  San Francisco Fire Department responded. Employee #1 was transported to Kaiser  Hospital in San Francisco. He was treated and released the same day. Employee  #1 subsequently returned to the hospital for further treatment for a shattered  right heel  fractured toes  and a fractured ankle. He was hospitalized for 8  days and underwent two surgeries where rods and bolts were implanted into his  right foot and toes. Employee #2 was transported to San Francisco General  Hospital. He was treated for a bruised neck  shoulder  ribs  arm  foot  and  side. He was released the same day. This incident was reported to Cal/OSHA by  the San Francisco Fire Department on August 19  2013. Cal/OSHA sent an  investigator to the job site on August 19  2013  to begin the investigation.  It was determined that there were no witnesses to the incident. The foreman  was on another floor of the building. Interviews were conducted with Employees  #1 and #2  the project superintendent  the foreman  the field safety manager   the forklift operator  and the general contractor's management staff. It was  determined that the stack of plywood had not been secured. The foreman stated  that the plywood had a laminated top MDO (medium density overlay) and each  sheet weighed approximately 45 pounds. The total weight of 13 pieces of  plywood would have been just under 600 pounds. T8 CCR 1549(d) requires piles  of plywood stacked on edge to be positively secured to prevent tipping or  falling. The employer was cited one serious accident-related violation of this  regulation. The employer also was cited for failure to report to Cal/OSHA  Employee #1's 8-day hospital stay. The investigator observed other violations   and the employer was cited accordingly.                                         ",

At approximately  7:45 a.m.  the employee stepped on one of the two planks to cross over the  excavated area. The plank broke  and the employee fell approximately 4 feet.  He landed on his right heel  and his right heel bone shattered. Paramedics  transported him to Kaiser in San Francisco  where his broken foot was  immobilized for later surgery  which was performed August 8  2011.
