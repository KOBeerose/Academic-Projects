The loader's boom  attachment was rigged with four  8 ft wire ropes attached to two eye hooks  which were used to off load the K-rail from the truck. Employee #1 would  position the hooks in the eyelets of the K-rail and then direct the operator  to remove them.

The  employee was to help off load the dredged materials once they arrived at the  dump site. The barge was secured to a tugboat that had a crew of four people  plus an Inspector representing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The employee  remained on the barge  staying on the left side of the two-compartment scow  house. The trip began at 7:00 a.m. and at 11:15 p.m.  the crew attempted to  contact the employee by mobile radio and then by their horn. They did not  receive a response. The captain sent a crew member over to the barge and at  11:20 p.m.  the crew member reported the scowman was not responsive. The crew  member and the USACE Inspector performed Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  but were unable to resuscitate him. The U.S. Coast Guard was notified. The  Coast Guard met the tug/barge at the entrance of the New Haven Harbor and  moved the employee to Coast Guard boat at 11:50 p.m. Employee #1 had died and  was taken to Yale New Haven Hospital. It was determined that during the trip  to New Haven  the employee had a mobile gas powered generator  used to power  the charging unit of the hand-held radio and a small electric heater for use  in the scow house. The employee died from carbon dioxide poisoning.             ",

He dropped the pile sheet into the ground slot.  Then  as he raised the vibro hammer to an approximate height of 30 feet  one  of the retainer/fastening bolts sheared off inside the fixed jaw of the  hydraulic clamp. The load now was supported by only one bolt. Due to  vibration  that bolt loosened. The jaw along the bolts came out from the  hydraulic clamp body  fell  bounced off the pile sheet  and struck Employee  #1's left foot. This occurred as he stood approximately 15 to 20 feet away  from the suspended hammer's danger zone. Employee #1 was transported to the  San Leandro Hospital  where he was admitted and treated for displaced  fractures of the second  third  and fourth metatarsals in his left foot. He  was discharged on July 20  2013. Based on the interviews conducted and  documentation developed during the subsequent investigation  it was determined  that neither the general contractor nor the subcontractor (Employee #1's  employer) had violated any of the Title 8 code sections. Employee #1 and all  his coworkers were well experienced and trained. At the time Employee #1 was  injured  he and all his coworkers were standing away from the danger zone and  not under the suspended load.

The hospital was undergoing renovations. The plastic sheet  was placed over the atrium to maintain negative pressure and prevent  construction dust from entering the nearby and connected VA Medical Center   which was an active location in the hospital. The open-air atrium measured  approximately 24 ft by 45 ft. Second floor and roof deck guardrails had  surrounded the top of the atrium  but had been demolished over the summer.  Additionally  DBI-Sala anchors that employees had used to demolish the  guardrail had been removed. After demolishing the guardrail  the top of the  atrium was enclosed by a locked construction fence. During a prejob meeting  that occurred at approximately 11:00 a.m. on October 11  2012  a crew attached  plastic poly sheeting under the existing sheeting drooping inside the  building. The crew used a scissor lift to attach this plastic to the inside  edge of a 2in by 4 ft wood frame around the atrium  instead of the second  floor and roof deck surrounding the edge of the atrium opening. Further  the  crew did not discuss what would be required for employees that access and work  from second floor and roof deck. Employee #1 and the coworker were instructed  to stay in the scissors lift and install the plastic from below. However  they  were not told that this was because no guardrails or approved fall protection  anchors were in the area around the atrium opening. When Employee #1  his  coworker and the rest of the crew were assembled to discuss the job  they  informed the foreman that the job could not be accomplished from below the  existing plastic using the scissors lifts. The foreman then directed the crew  to install the rolled poly plastic over the existing plastic and from the  second floor and roof deck. The foreman stated that he did not discuss or  receive permission for this change in the work procedure with the operations  manager. The site superintendent was also not aware of the change in the work  procedure. Further  the foreman and others had not been on the roof before the  work commenced.

They were working northeast  of Baltimore  Maryland  near Kenwood Avenue and the Baltimore Beltway. The  crew had removed a 30-foot high steel camera pole at an interchange and had  secured the pole onboard a Ford National crane truck. Because a portion of the  pole was extending past the end of the truck  a safety vest was tied to the  end of the pole. The crew took the pole to the State Highway Administration  communication repair facility (\"radio yard\") at 5901 Baltimore National Pike   where they arrived around 1:30 p.m. Checking with the State Highway  Administration employees  they were instructed to place the pole next to a  previously placed pole up against the fence on the east side of the yard. The  crew foreman assigned the other two employees to set up the crane truck and to  unload the 30-foot-long steel pole. The pole weighed between 900 and 1 000  pounds. The truck was brought into place  and the straps were removed from the  pole. The crane's hook was unlatched and the pole was attached to the straps  and the crane hook. While this was going on  a State Highway Administration  truck with two employees inside drove into the yard; its driver asked the  crew's foreman a question about the camera that had been removed from the  pole. The foreman was standing at the driver's side of the State Highway  Administration truck with his back to the crane truck  about 25 to 30 feet  away from the crane truck. The crane operator  who was Employee #1  had  lowered the outriggers on the passenger's side of his crane truck  and the  landing pads were in place. The outriggers were lowered on the driver's side  but without the pads. None of the four outriggers was extended at all. The  crane operator raised the crane's boom and then the pole up and off the truck.  The groundman  who was Employee #2  was holding onto the safety vest tied to  the end of the pole to help steady the pole and to guide it to the storage  location. The pole had to travel up and over numerous fiber reels of various  sizes  some of them as high as 6 feet  3 inches. As the pole went over one of  the fiber reels  it contacted the reel  scratching the thumb of the groundman  and drawing blood. He let go of the safety vest  and the pole bounced. He  looked at his finger and started walking around the fiber reels to grab the  safety vest again. As he did  he noticed that the crane truck was tipping  over. He yelled to the operator to get off the truck. The operator jumped from  the bed of the truck  landing on his feet. The foreman and the State Highway  employees ran over to see if Employees #1 and #2 were alright. Employee #1   the crane operator  sustained bruises  contusions  and abrasions on his legs  in the jump from the truck. Employee #2  the groundman  sustained a laceration  on his finger.

Employee #1 was in an International bucket  truck with a Versalift bucket assembly  while one of his coworkers  a  fifth-stage apprentice  worked with hot sticks and rubber gloves on the east  side of the pole opposite the bucket. Existing conductors had been placed  vertically instead of in the usual horizontal manner  so the work involved  moving the street side  neutral 12 kilovolt conductors to the field side pole  pin position.

There were four sets of motor  and pump units in the boiler room. Two months prior to this job  Employee #1  had replaced one of these set. On the day of the accident  they were replacing  another motor and pump unit. All the valves were shut and the motor and pump  unit had been removed from the 12 in. hot water pipe when a motor from one of  the other three units automatically restarted. Employee #1 heard a whooshing  sound coming from the open water pipe  and 120 degress F water started to  spray out. Employee #1 attempted to cap off the pipe; Employee #2 went to  notify the hotel engineer and then returned to help Employee #1. The hotel  engineer was checking the valves and tightening some nuts and bolts on the  couplings when Employees #1 and #2 were suddenly sprayed with hot water.  Paramedics responded and both employees were taken to St. Francis Hospital.  Employee #1 was treated for first- and second-degree burns to his abdomen.  Employee #2 was treated for first- and second-degree burns to the back of his  legs. The employer was cited for two general accident-related violations. The  hotel had only one check valve for the 12 in. hot water pipe that served the  entire 42-story building. There were no other intermediate check valves  throughout the piping system. California Code of Regulations T8 3329(d)  states: \"When dismantling or opening closed pressurized or gravity fed  systems  internal pressure shall be relieved or other methods utilized to  prevent sudden release of pressure or spraying of liquid.\" One of the  functions of the check valve would have been to prevent backflow. It was  discovered after the incident that the check valve was not working properly.  As a result  it did not have the capacity to stop the water from flowing back  into the boiler room. The other general accident-related violations are from  T8 GISO section 3314(c) and (g)  which require a lockout/de-energizing of  electrical equipment. Prior to the removal of the motor and pump unit  the  other 3 units were not de-energized to prevent them from building-up water  pressure of a minimum of 20 psi. The boiler was also not shut down to prevent  build-up of water temperature. A hazard control procedure was not developed by  the employer. A reference was also made to T8 3314(i)  which required on-site  lockout procedures to be followed by outside servicing personnel.               ",

The line was approximately 400 feet (122 meters) long and six inches (150  millimeters) in diameter. The workers were in the middle of a street. The  sewer pipe line was approximately 4 feet (1.2 meters) underground and ran  diagonally beneath the middle of Oakwood Street. Workers were using the  \"cured-in-place\" technique at this work site. This technique required that a  tube membrane material be inserted from a manhole and through the sewer and  then retrieved through the next manhole. The first step the workers performed  after preparing the materials was inversion; this process pushed the tube  membrane from one end of the sewer line to the other end through the  bombardment of cool water. The workers installed Enviroliners membrane  material securely in place within the sewer line from one manhole to the next  with cool water  flushing it for approximately one hour. Immediately  afterward  they began to flush it with hot water at a temperature of up to 150  degrees Fahrenheit (66 degrees Celsius) at 5 pounds psi (34.5 kPa). The hot  water reacted with the polyester  vinyl-ester and epoxy resin in the membrane.  Hot water bombardment would take approximately up to three hours for the  chemical composition to react and to harden this membrane into a hard and  durable pipe material in order to maintain a constant wall thickness of a  pipe. It was done to create a durable  continuous  and smooth interior to  promote and improve strength of the 6-inch 150-millimeter) diameter sewer line  pipe. While flushing the membrane with hot water from a steam truck  Employee  #1 was adjusting the temperature controls from a truck that was right beside  the manhole. The narrative did not specify whether the controls were on a  second truck. The connection went from the hot water steam truck hose through  a manifold  using a sleeve connector  to the membrane  and then on to the  sewer line. At approximately 6:00 p.m.  the membrane area near the manifold  and sleeve connector burst open  and a few cups of hot water squirted out and  onto Employee #1  who was standing nearby. He sustained third-degree burns to  his left elbow  forearm  and left lower back. He cried out in pain and fell to  the ground. His foreman  who was nearby  saw what had happened and immediately  turned off the water flow from the steam truck. Employee #1 was taken to a  Kaiser-Permanente facility in Redwood City and then to St. Francis Hospital   where he received treatment for his injuries. Employee #1 was hospitalized  over 24 hours. The employer reported the incident to the Division the next  day. The Division opened an inspection fourteen days later  on July 3  2013.  At the time of this inspection  the foreman and other employees stated that  what had transpired was a typical day on the job except for the membrane's  bursting  which had never happened before. The foreman stated that the  membrane's bursting at low pressure was an anomaly and probably due to a  factory defect. The foreman stated that the membrane burst at its seams   because it was defective. At the time of the inspection  the membrane that had  burst had already been thrown away.

The waterproofing sealant was pumped from the truck through a  hose to an employee on the other end of a spray gun nozzle. The flow of the  sealant was controlled from the truck as well. In order for the sealant to be  applied properly  the materials had to be stored and supplied at a consistent  temperature.

To keep the sealant flowing   Employee #1 would remove the lid from a 5-gallon bucket  carry it several  feet  and pour the material into the 55-gallon drum.

The company had been contracted to  install a swimming pool and spa in Ft Myers  FL. Employee #1 had delivered  gunite material  a combination of sand and cement mix  to the location. A  four-person team was also at the accident site to spray and shape the gunite  as it was dispensed from the gunite truck. The crew was positioned forty to  sixty feet away from the truck; they last saw the driver heading toward the  truck with a shovel. Although the truck was empty at the time of the accident   the crew's supervisor assumed that the driver was going to the truck to bang  the shovel against the sides of the bin. This act would have loosened any sand  that had become stuck inside on the wall of the bin. It was often done by  drivers  but only from the outside. Minutes later  the supervisor released one  of the crew members to see if the driver needed assistance. The truck was  empty  and no product was being dispensed by the truck. The crew member  arrived at the truck but could not locate the driver. The truck's auger  which  was still in operation at this time  made it difficult to hear. The crew  member remained at the rear of the truck waiting for the driver. It was at  this time that he noticed a piece of clothing being expelled from the auger.  He quickly turned the truck off and immediately notified his supervisor. The  shovel was found on the top edge of the sand bin undamaged. The supervisor  found Employee #1 inside the truck's sand bin  caught in the 9-inch auger  located in the bottom of the bin. The supervisor called emergency medical  services. The driver was alive when he was extracted from the auger  but he  died on the scene while being attended to by emergency responders due to leg  amputations. The mobile gunite truck was a 1989 International industrial truck  which contained two bins. One bin held sand  and the other held cement mix.  The truck had a 9-inch diameter auger  17 feet  7 inches in length  which ran  through the bottom of both bins. The auger transferred sand from the sand bin  to the cement mix bin. The two materials were combined and sent to another  auger  the mixing auger  located at the rear of the truck. The mixing auger  was located outside the truck bins. It extended 9 feet  9 inches in the rear  of the truck. Although there was a ladder located at the rear of the truck   the only time it was used was when the driver visually inspected the load to  ensure that a full load was received when material was being loaded into the  truck. The loading area was located at the employer's establishment in Cape  Coral  FL. The mobile gunite truck had several warning labels posted on the  outside of the truck warning of the dangers of the auger  including serious  injury  amputation  and death. The driver had been employed eight months. He  had received guidelines and training on driver responsibilities on November  20  2009.                                                                       ",

A wall fence  measuring 36 feet in length and 98 inches high from the bottom of the trench  to the top of the wall was on the South side of the trench. The bottom of the  trench was even with the bottom of the wall foundation. The stability of the  wall was endangered by the excavation and compaction operations. Employee #1's  employer did not provide a support system  such as bracing  shoring or  underpinning  to protect employees. The wall collapsed  pinning two employees   including Employee #1  between the wall and the side of the trench. The  position of the Ramax compactor in the trench and some blocks that became  wedged between the collapsed wall and top of the trench kept the wall from  fatally crushing the two employees. The other employee received minor  injuries. Employee #1 spent six days in Saint Francis hospital for broken ribs  and had a ruptured spleen removed.                                              ",

For  unknown reasons  Employee #1 had pushed a large amount of fill into the lake   in the center of the fill area  instead of moving in a consistent left to  right pattern.

Employee #1 was operating a 9-foot 5-inches wide articulating truck on a  12-foot 4-inch wide berm which ran adjacent to the retention pond. Employee #1  had been with the company about 18 years and was considered by his foreman to  be an experienced heavy equipment operator. At the time of the accident  the  employer was in the process of raising the berm by 6 inches by using the  articulating truck to dump material  which was then bulldozed to level it  and  then a mobile compactor was used to compact it in place. The employer had four  employees on site; three operating the different pieces of equipment and a  foreman. The weather was sunny and clear. The work was being conducted at the  Miami- Dade Water and Sewer Department construction of a new waste water  treatment plant in Homestead  Florida. The 49 075 pound Caterpillar Model 725  articulating truck was travelling on a western direction at the north end of  the retention pond when the edge of the berm gave way and fell into the water.  According to authorities  the retention pond depth ranges from 21 feet at the  edge to 50 to 60 feet at the middle of the pond. Employee #1 could not be  extricated from the articulating truck until July 23  2008 due to it being  stuck and the door could not be opened by rescue divers. The Medical Examiner  listed Employee #1's cause of death as drowning and blunt force injury.         ",

Employee #1's employer was subcontracted to  Segue Construction  Inc.  the general contractor  to install underground  plumbing and related plumbing trenches. The employer's workers had excavated a  relatively shallow sewer trench  approximately 2 feet 6 inches deep. They then  set the pipe in the trench. Their work progressed toward one end of the site   while another contractor followed behind to excavate a deeper trench and  install in it the electrical utility. Employee #1 was instructed by Coworker  #1  a manager  to drop back to areas where the sewer pipe had been recently  installed and to tape plastic sleeving for corrosion protection to the 4-inch  sanitary sewer riser. Due to the configuration of site utilities  there were  several locations where the sewer and electrical trenches crossed. One of  these locations was Grid Line 8  between Grid Lines M and N  where the  electrical trench had been excavated crosswise to the sewer trench and  approximately 3 feet from the sewer riser. The work was scheduled so that the  excavation activities of the two trades were not physically conflicting.  Employee #1 worked safely within the sewer trench  installing the plastic  sleeving. He then exited the shallow trench to retrieve more tape. He climbed  out of the sewer trench at the corner where it intersected with the deeper  electrical trench. The corner broke off  and Employee #1 fell into the deeper  electrical trench  a fall height of 7 feet. Although Employee #1 climbed out  of the trench on his own  he was gasping for breath. Coworker #2 came over and  evaluated Employee #1. Coworker #1 called for an ambulance after Employee #1  lost consciousness.

During  Cal/OSHA's subsequent investigation  it was determined that Diablo Plumbing  was a plumbing contractor that performed work on a wide range of both  residential and commercial projects  including related excavation work. The  investigation report concluded that the employer had failed to reevaluate the  trench conditions when the situation changed. The top edges and corners of the  trench were beveled in many places from drying and cracking and/or minor  sloughing. Where the newer  deeper electrical conduit trench was excavated at  right angles to the sewer trench  the drying reentrant corners where the  trenches met constituted a new hazard to Employee #1  who was working in one  of these areas.

The  crane was a boom truck that was being operated in a closed 11-foot lane  the  fast lane  on one of two bridges  the westbound bridge. Employee #1 operated  the crane without the outriggers extended and with only the jacks down. This  was because the single lane closure did not allow sufficient space to extend  the 17-foot outriggers. The crane was being used to remove the temporary work  platform located on the inside of the bridge. The needle beams were being  removed from under the work platform and were being loaded onto a flatbed  truck that was parked behind the crane. Each beam weighed 1 796 pounds and  measured 21 feet in length. Employee #1 lifted four beams with the crane. He  was removing the fifth beam when that beam started swinging. Employee #1 lost  control of the load and the crane. The crane tipped over and the boom landed  on the eastbound bridge. Employee #1 sustained a knee injury. He was  transported to a hospital  where he received treatment for a knee  bruise/abrasion. He then was released. Maryland OSHA's investigation  determined that the crane collapsed between the 50-foot span of the two  bridges  above the creek that ran 60 feet below. At the time of the collapse   the crane's hydraulic boom was extended to 58 feet and the boom angle was 65  feet. The load chart requires that the boom angle be at a maximum of 45 feet  with the boom extended to 58 feet. Therefore  the crane was being operated  outside the safe parameters required by the manufacturer's load charts.  Employee #1 and his two coworkers were exposed to struck-by hazards while  working with the mobile crane.                                                  ",

He applied fire stop to the electrical conduits in the walls on the first  floor. The conduits brought wires up from the basement  where high-voltage  power lines entered the building  and reduced the voltage to 120/240 volts.  Employee #1 then remembered a 1 1/2 in. conduit inside one of the service  cabinets  which was on the ground floor. The conduit needed a strap installed  before more power lines could be brought up from the basement. Employee #1  removed two corner screws in the cabinet's door so he could open it and he was  leaning forward over the splash apron to access the conduit when his head  contacted a 120-volt busbar. He received an electric shock and was rendered  unconscious. A coworker started CPR and revived him. Employee #1 sustained  small burns on the bottom of his right arm and left thumb  which provided  paths for the electricity  and a severe burn on the right front part of his  skull. All the service cabinets on the first floor were de-energized except  for one that was backfed to supply 120 volts for lighting the building. The  cabinet Employee #1 opened had a lockout on the breaker that was accessible  from outside the cabinet  However  when he removed the corner screws  the lock  stayed on the breaker as the door opened. The busbars inside the cabinet were  also backfed and  had the breaker been closed  an explosion would have  occurred in the basement.                                                       ",
