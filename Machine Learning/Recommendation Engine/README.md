## How to Run the Project Locally

To run the Movie Recommendation Engine project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-engine.git
``` 

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd movie-recommendation-engine
```

3. Install the required Python packages and dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

 ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Start the Streamlit application:

 ```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
5. Open your web browser and access the application at http://localhost:8501.

You can now interact with the Movie Recommendation Engine and explore personalized movie recommendations based on different algorithms and data sources.

Enjoy discovering new movies and enhancing your movie-watching experience! ðŸ¤“
