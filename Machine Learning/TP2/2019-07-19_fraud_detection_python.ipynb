    "A typical organization loses an estimated 5% of its yearly revenue to fraud. In this course, learn to fight fraud by using data. Apply supervised learning algorithms to detect fraudulent behavior based upon past fraud, and use unsupervised learning methods to discover new types of fraud activities. \n",

    "Fraudulent transactions are rare compared to the norm.  As such, learn to properly classify imbalanced datasets.\n",

It retrieves the details of the topics for each line of text. With that function, you can append the results back to your original data.
