\Large In the scope of our second-year studies at the National Institut of Posts and Telecommunications, we were brought to make this project entitled \textbf{"Installing and Using Apache Hadoop and Spark"} for the \textbf{INTRODUCTION To BIG DATA Course}.
\\\\
The final goal of this project is to go through several steps in order to install and configure Apache \textbf{Hadoop} and run a \textbf{MapReduce} program in a \textbf{single} node and \textbf{multi-node} cluster. As well as Installing and using Apache \textbf{Spark}.
\\\\
\textbf{Apache Hadoop} is software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers, and \textbf{Apache Spark} is a fast, parallel processing system. It provides high level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports the execution of graphs. 
\\\\
So in this project we are going to configure and use both of them on the open source \textbf{ubuntu-20.04.3 LTS} OS. \\
