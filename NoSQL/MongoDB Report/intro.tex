\Large In the scope of our second-year studies at the National Institut of Posts and Telecommunications, we were brought to make this project entitled \textbf{"Installation and manipulation of MongoDB"} for the \textbf{INTRODUCTION TO NOSQL DATABASES}.
\\\\
The final goal of this project is to go through several steps in order to install and configure  \textbf{MongoDB} and Examining some MongoDB \textbf{Query Features} as well as Implementing an application with \textbf{Node.js} and MongoDB and carrying out \textbf{CRUD} operations.
\\\\
\textbf{MongoDB} is a source-available cross-platform \textbf{document-oriented database program}. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses  \textbf{JSON-like} documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is written in C++, characterized by \textbf{“Availability”} and \textbf{“Partitioning tolerance”}.
\\\\
So in this project we are going to configure and use MongoDB on the open source \textbf{ubuntu-20.04.3 LTS} OS. \\
