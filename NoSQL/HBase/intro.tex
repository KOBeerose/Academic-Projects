\Large In the scope of our second-year studies at the National Institut of Posts and Telecommunications, we were brought to make this project entitled \textbf{"Installing and Using Apache HBase"} for the \textbf{INTRODUCTION TO NOSQL DATABASES}.
\\\\
The final goal of this project is to go through several steps in order to install and configure Apache \textbf{HBase} and doing some \textbf{Manipulation} with it in and Using the HBase \textbf{Java API} As well as performing some Data processing with \textbf{Spark}.
\\\\
\textbf{Apache HBase} is an open-source \textbf{non-relational distributed database}modeled after Google's Bigtable and written in Java. It is developed as part of Apache Software Foundation's Apache Hadoop project and runs on top of \textbf{HDFS}.
\\\\
So in this project we are going to configure and use HBase on the open source \textbf{ubuntu-20.04.3 LTS} OS. \\
