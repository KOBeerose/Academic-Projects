{
\item \textbf{-Installation and configuration of a single node in Hadoop.} \\[0.7cm]
\item \textbf{-Running a Mapreduce program with 1-node.}\\[0.7cm]
\item \textbf{-Configuration of a multi-node cluster in Apache Hadoop.}\\[0.7cm]
\item \textbf{-Running Map/Reduce in a multi-node cluster.}\\[0.7cm]
\item \textbf{-Installing and configuring Spark locally.}\\[0.7cm]
\item \textbf{-Manipulating RDDs using the pyspark terminal.}\\[0.7cm]
\item \textbf{-Executing "Word Count" using the scala termina.}\\[0.7cm]
\item \textbf{And finally, Running a Spark Batch Application in Java.}\\[0.7cm]
